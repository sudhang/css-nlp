0,"WASHINGTON — In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt. “Yesterday the Senate cast one of the most expensive votes in history,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said at the time. “Americans are wondering how we’re going to pay for all this.” Nine years later, during one of the longest economic expansions in American history, almost every Republican in Congress — including Mr. McConnell, now the majority leader — supports a tax plan that is projected to cause an even larger increase in the federal debt. Republicans got to that extraordinary point by a tangled path. First they argued that the tax cuts would stimulate the economy enough to pay for themselves, only to be confronted on Thursday with a report that said the cuts would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade. That bad news led to last-minute convulsions and a frantic search for more revenue. But in the end, the political imperative to pass what would be the only major piece of legislation of President Trump’s first year, along with a near-religious Republican belief in tax cuts, overrode their previous concerns about fiscal prudence. All but one Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted for the bill early Saturday. The House and the Senate still have to reach a final agreement on the details, and Mr. Trump has to sign his name, but the Republican Party now stands on the verge of driving up the national debt after spending much of the last decade promising rectitude and criticizing Democrats for profligacy. The legislation reads “as if it were developed for a country whose debt problems have been solved, when in reality debt is the highest it has ever been other than around World War II,” declared the co-chairmen of a bipartisan commission created in 2010 to propose measures for reducing the debt. Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, formerly President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, said the current crop of Republicans are avoiding “nearly all the hard choices.” Mr. McConnell has a well-documented history of fretting about the debt. “We’d like to do something about the nation’s biggest problem, spending and debt, which of course is the reason for this economic malaise,” he said in 2011. He added that Republicans could not address the problem because they did not control the White House or Senate. Last year, with Republicans in control of the House and the Senate and about to claim the White House, he reiterated his distaste for debt. “I think this level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,” Mr. McConnell said. “My preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral.” He continued in words that now seem particularly striking. “What I hope we will clearly avoid, and I’m confident we will, is a trillion-dollar stimulus,” he said. “Take you back to 2009. We borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything. So we need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly.” This week, the congressional scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, reported that the Senate’s tax plan is, in fact, a stimulus plan that costs $1 trillion — the amount it would add to the debt over the next decade after accounting for its significant economic benefits. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who shepherded the House’s version of the tax bill — which also would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade — has assiduously cultivated a reputation for concern about the federal debt. In 2011 he released “The Path to Prosperity,” a budget plan proposing large spending cuts to balance the books. He said fiscal discipline was unpopular but necessary. “What I do know is I can’t look my kids and my constituents in the eyes with my conscience being clear and not know that I didn’t do everything I could to try and fix this problem,” Mr. Ryan said in a 2011 interview with CNBC. In 2013, he said the debt “will weigh down our country like an anchor.” At the time, the federal debt held by investors equaled 72 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The Republican tax plan could push that to 85 percent by 2021, Goldman Sachs estimated Wednesday, which would be the highest debt ratio since the immediate aftermath of World War II. Republicans are gambling that voters would rather have tax cuts now and worry about debt later. That is certainly the position of the corporate sector, which has abandoned pious expressions of concern about Washington’s extravagance in favor of earnest pleas for tax relief. “Passing tax reform is the single most important thing that Congress can do to make American companies more competitive,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said last month. A number of prominent Republicans have defiantly insisted that economic forecasters are wrong about the likely cost of the tax cuts. They say the legislation will cause a surge of economic growth that will allow the government to collect just as much money at lower tax rates. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the analysis of the economists Congress employs for that purpose, using techniques he has endorsed, as “curious.” The Trump administration, without offering evidence, continues to insist the federal debt will not rise. Republicans also have long distinguished between deficits caused by spending increases and deficits caused by tax cuts. They argue that tax cuts are good for the economy, and that the resulting problem of larger deficits should be addressed by reducing government spending. “You also have to bring spending under control,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week. “And not discretionary spending. That isn’t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.” The tax cuts, however, would increase the scale of that challenge. Politicians of both parties also have lost their fear of debt in recent decades. The federal debt has grown much larger than was considered wise or even possible, with few apparent consequences. “Reagan proved that deficits don’t matter,” Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002. Many Republicans take the view that the George W. Bush administration’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 proved the same point. But federal borrowing imposes real economic costs, not least the need to make interest payments. It also restricts the funding available to private-sector investors. And experts continue to warn that the United States is on an unsustainable trajectory, particularly because the government has promised benefits to an expanding population of older Americans that will further outstrip tax revenue. “It’s the type of thing that should keep people awake at night,” Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, told a congressional committee last week. But in Washington, in 2017, such warnings are no longer in vogue.","WASHINGTON — In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt. “Yesterday the Senate cast one of the most expensive votes in history,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said at the time.","WASHINGTON — In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt. “Yesterday the Senate cast one of the most expensive votes in history,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said at the time.. The vote was 52 to 47 against. But then came the financial meltdown and the government shutdown that followed. Republicans were split on how to handle the spending bill, which passed by a narrow margin. Some wanted to keep the money flowing as quickly as possible while others argued for austerity measures or even repeal. After all, the Obama administration had promised to veto any legislation that did not include tax cuts and other changes needed to reduce deficits. So the debate over what should be done with the billions of dollars spent on the economy turned into something more like a political football game than a policy fight: Who is going to pay for this? What will happen if we don’t get our way? And who should pay for it? That question has been debated since before the recession hit. It has also become increasingly urgent after President Trump took office last year, when he vowed to cut taxes and free up capital for investment. As his first major legislative achievement, Mr. Trump signed into law a sweeping rewrite of the nation’s immigration laws. He promised to roll back regulations imposed during the previous decade and impose stiff fines on companies that do business in areas where there are no environmental protections. His new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has already taken aim at those rules. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump plans to sign another order barring foreign governments from cutting off American citizens’ access to health insurance markets. And he intends to make good on promises made by former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush to build infrastructure projects across America. Those moves have raised concerns about whether the United States can afford the costs of such programs without significant revenue increases from the private sector. The budget deficit is projected to grow to nearly $1 trillion next fiscal year, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. With interest payments on the national debt soaring, some economists worry that taxpayers may end up footing the bill for years of lost growth. “We need to start thinking about what are the priorities,” said David Cutler, the chief economist at Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. “Is it infrastructure, education, research, energy? Or is it jobs and wages?” A bipartisan group of senators recently asked Mr. Trump to consider revising the tax code so that corporations could deduct their overseas profits. They proposed doubling the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly and allowing people to write off unused medical expenses. Mr. Trump said he would look into the idea but declined to comment on specifics. “I am looking at everything, including the corporate rate,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this month. “I am looking at making sure that everybody pays their fair share. I want everybody to pay their fair share.” For now, Democrats say they are willing to accept less spending on defense and domestic programs in exchange for raising taxes on wealthy Americans and closing loopholes that allow them to avoid paying income taxes. But Democrats are still far apart on many issues, including how much to raise the estate tax, which currently applies only to inherited wealth. And they remain divided over whether to expand Social Security benefits, which cost roughly $2 trillion per year. While the party controls both houses of Congress, it does not control the White House, and its leaders cannot unilaterally change the country’s entitlement program. Party unity on these matters is critical to keeping the government open, which helps ensure that lawmakers can work together to pass bills. If they fail to reach agreement, however, the government might shut down again. Last week, Mr. Trump suggested that he might be willing to revisit the issue of entitlements. “If you believe that you’re entitled to certain things, then maybe you shouldn’t be receiving them,” Mr. Trump said in a speech to the National Rifle Association. “You shouldn’t be getting your check. You shouldn’t be getting your food stamps. You shouldn’t be getting your housing allowance. Why? Because it’s unfair.” Republicans are hoping to use their majority to force Democrats to take a stand on entitlement reform, either through the passage of a constitutional amendment requiring the expansion of Social Security benefits or an overhaul of the program itself. But many Democrats fear that such a move would alienate voters, especially African-Americans, whom they say they represent. And they are wary of being seen as soft on crime. But they concede that the best option is to wait until the current system is reformed before expanding Social Security benefits. That is why Mr. Trump appears eager to push ahead with entitlement reforms, despite having just signed an executive order restricting deportations of young immigrants brought illegally to the United States. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has called for increasing military spending and reducing regulation on oil and gas drilling. But he has yet to put forward any ideas about the future of Medicare and Medicaid. When pressed for details, he said the Affordable Care Act was “probably dead” because it would have left too many people uninsured. He also suggested that Social Security benefits should be cut back in favor of a new system of entitlement programs. And when asked about his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, Mr. Trump replied: “I don’t know how you do that. I mean, we can’t pay for it. We need a big wall. It’s not going to happen.” As president, Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to slash taxes and reduce regulations — but he has never offered specifics on how to achieve those goals. His campaign promises are often vague or aspirational, leaving Americans with little guidance as they try to navigate a political landscape where Washington is increasingly polarized over immigration policy. The most prominent example of this is Mr. Trump’s promise to build a wall between America and Mexico. While some Republicans support building walls across the country, others say such barriers are unnecessary and expensive. A number of Republican lawmakers have proposed replacing current laws requiring employers to provide health insurance to their workers with a single-payer government program. Such proposals, however, would require congressional approval and could face stiff opposition from Democrats who control both chambers of Congress. For now, there seems to be no consensus among Republicans about what form the nation’s immigration system should take. Some want a path to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants; others want them to apply only for work permits. Still others believe illegal immigration should be ended entirely. But even if a bipartisan solution were found, many Republicans still oppose such measures. They argue that such changes would increase economic inequality by encouraging more people to enter the labor force and lead to higher wages for American businesses and consumers. “We’re going to get rid of Obamacare,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told CNN last week. “But the biggest problem is the fact that our economy is based on a broken immigration system. That’s why we have so much unemployment, why we have so much poverty.” With Republicans controlling the House and Senate, the next step will be trying to pass legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law last year. But the bill must overcome fierce resistance from conservatives, including members of the Freedom Caucus, who fear that it would allow millions more Americans to remain uninsured. If passed, the replacement measure would probably include provisions similar to those included in the original Affordable Care Act, like expanding access to affordable contraception coverage and allowing states to opt out of certain requirements related to pre-existing medical conditions. Those changes might help stabilize premiums, although analysts warn that other aspects of the law, such as protections against discrimination and enforcement of existing federal rules, may pose greater obstacles to lowering costs. Mr. Trump himself has been open about his desire to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Speaking at a rally here on Thursday night, he promised to repeal the individual mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance, saying it had become “an embarrassment to us.” He also said he wanted to end subsidies paid by low-income families to buy private plans, calling it “a disgrace to taxpayers.” But since taking office, he has shown few signs of being ready to embrace a broader overhaul of the health care system. Instead, he has focused on repealing the Affordable Care Act and pushing through tax cuts aimed at helping corporations and wealthy individuals avoid paying billions of dollars in penalties. He has also pushed aggressively for tax reductions to fund infrastructure projects and to make college free. And he has sought to roll back parts of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law that helped create the modern financial industry. On Wednesday, he declared that the Federal Reserve needed to be abolished, saying that its actions were “the greatest threat to our economy in my lifetime.” “They’ve taken away your freedom,” Mr. Trump said. “You’re not allowed to go outside your borders. You’re not allowed to go buy things. You’re not allowed to leave your state. You’re not allowed to move. You’re not allowed to get married. You’re not allowed to be able to vote.” Asked about the prospect of legalizing the status of Dreamers, a group of immigrant youth whose legal status is protected by a Supreme Court decision, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that “we’ll see what happens” after the court issues its ruling.",GPT-NEO,True,the generated sometimes has a sentence with two dots/ points which makes clear that its the faked one as it doesn't make sense. 
1,"KHOGYANI, Afghanistan — When the American military dropped the largest bomb in its arsenal on an Islamic State cave complex here in eastern Afghanistan in April, the generals justified it as part of a robust campaign to destroy the group’s local affiliate by year’s end. Its force had been reduced to 700 fighters from 3,000, they said, and its area of operation diminished to three districts from 11. But as the year comes to a close, the Islamic State is far from being vanquished in eastern Afghanistan, even as the group is  on the run in its core territory in Iraq and Syria. It has waged brutal attacks that have displaced thousands of families and forced even some Taliban fighters, who had long controlled the mountainous terrain, to seek government protection. The shifting dynamic has, in turn, threatened the American-backed government’s tenuous hold on the region. And two years into the joint United States-Afghanistan operation, a clear understanding of the Islamic State affiliate, the latest enemy in the long Afghan war, still evades even some of those charged with fighting it. Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, recently said that 1,400 operations and airstrikes had “removed from the battlefield” more than 1,600 Islamic State fighters since March — more than double the estimate from early in the year. Some Afghan and other Western officials question whether those numbers are inflated, but the Americans say they are an indication that the group continues to replenish its ranks with new fighters. Part of the reason the two-year joint operation by the United States and Afghanistan against the Islamic State has made little progress is simply that the two forces are operating in a terrain where they have had little control for years. Airstrikes and commando operations bring bursts of pressure, but the militants have release valves all around them. On one side is the porous border with Pakistan, where many of the fighters come from. Elsewhere is largely Taliban country. “It’s like a balloon,” General Nicholson said. “We squeeze them in this area, and they’ll try to move out elsewhere.” A visit this month to Khogyani, a district in the east where Islamic State fighters have shifted, showed the increasing complexity of the Afghan conflict, and underlined how daunting a task it will be to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. The Afghan government’s authority in Khogyani, in a remote region of Nangarhar Province, has long been confined to the district compound and the immediate surroundings. The Taliban ruled the rest. Opium has been grown all around. After years of war with no clear victor, the region had settled into a strange sort of calm as the Taliban and the government found ways to coexist, as has happened to varying degrees around the country. Although the Taliban are known for their opposition to girls’ education, in Khogyani, the militants here allowed schooling, showing a willingness to drop a demand that had lost them hearts and minds before. In return for having nominal control, the government has paid the salaries of teachers and health workers that the Taliban could not afford. Abdul Jabar, who had been displaced from his home near the Pakistan border by recent battles between ISIS and the Taliban, said there was a two-story high school for girls close to his new home, with an enrollment of up to 1,600. Mir Haidar, who distributes vaccinations, said the three clinics there employed women, despite the Taliban’s past opposition to women in the workplace. So established was Taliban rule in Khogyani that when Islamic State fighters started shifting there, many people said they trusted in the Taliban’s protection. Then the Taliban lines started to buckle. “The Taliban were puffing their chest — ‘We are strong, don’t go, we will take care of you,’ ” said Abdul Qadeem, a father of 13. “Then,” he said, the Islamic State “arrived at night, and we left with nothing but this shawl on my shoulder.” The Islamic State’s local affiliate in Afghanistan first emerged in 2014, swiftly gaining ground across Nangarhar Province. It quickly drew the attention of the United States military, which had scaled down its presence in Afghanistan to a small counterterrorism mission against Al Qaeda and a larger NATO mission to train Afghan forces to hold their ground against the Taliban. American and Afghan officials now have little reason to believe that the Afghan group, despite pledging allegiance to ISIS, maintains regular contact or receives directions from the Islamic State operating in Iraq and Syria. Instead, they say, the Islamic State in Afghanistan is largely made up of Pakistani militants pushed across the border by military operations in that country. The militants used the Afghan mountains simply as a safe haven at first, before embracing the Islamic State and turning their weapons on Afghanistan. Opinions are divided on how and why. Some officials believe it was only a matter of time before extremists seeking relevance would be attracted to the Islamic State. Others say the Afghan and American militaries miscalculated and fostered a new enemy by going after Pakistani militants seeking safe havens in Afghanistan in the hopes that the Pakistanis would reciprocate with Afghan Taliban leaders on their soil. A third theory blames the cynical designs of Pakistan’s intelligence agency, which Afghans have long accused of trying to destabilize their government. No matter who they are, the militants have brought more violence and suffering to Afghan civilians. In Khogyani, American airstrikes intended to destroy the Islamic State may have temporarily depleted its forces, but they have also upended the relative peace. Afghan officials say they believe the fighting between the Islamic State and the Taliban has little to do with ideology. “The reason they are fighting each other is over resources, and over territory,” said Mohammed Gulab Mangal, the governor of Nangarhar Province, who says both groups “drink from the same spring” — a subtle reference to their perceived Pakistani origins. People in Khogyani say the Islamic State militants are better armed and fight harder than the Taliban. “If you tie a Taliban fighter to the trunk of this tree, and then you tell him ISIS is coming, he will run so hard that he will uproot the tree with him,” said Malik Makee, a tribal elder who runs a militia of several dozen men in support of the government, helping to maintain a buffer around the district center. Mr. Makee is an example of how fluid alliances can be here. He lived under Taliban rule for years, without much problem, until they killed one of his sons. He retaliated by killing six Taliban, and then packing up to join the government. Mr. Makee — who admits to growing opium, as many in the district do — is one of the three men running the war in Khogyani on behalf of the government. All three are veterans of many previous conflicts. The busiest of them these days is a potbellied intelligence operative in his 50s who is trying to peel away Taliban commanders and foot soldiers fleeing the Islamic State. His agents make a simple argument to potential defectors: You have no escape from the Islamic State, so come to us for protection. About three dozen have. On a recent afternoon, the operative completed a deal with two Taliban over tea and raisins in a dark room of the district compound. The men, both of whom fought the government for six years, were disarmed of a rocket-propelled grenade, a Kalashnikov and a pistol. When the operative asked if the two Taliban had government IDs, they pulled them out, neatly wrapped in plastic sheets. Asked how they had obtained the documents, one of the men, who gave his name as Zabihullah Ghorzang, replied: “My uncle was the district governor here.” Putting his hand on Mr. Ghorzang’s knee, the operative said the men’s decision to join the government’s side was patriotic. The government had forgiven their wrongdoings. The deal complete, Mr. Ghorzang was given back his pistol. But Mr. Makee, who was at the meeting, couldn’t keep quiet. “The government can forgive you for all it wants,” he told the two Taliban. “But if I find out that you had done anything wrong against my men, I swear I will chase you wherever you hide.” Lt. Col. Noor Agha, the third of the three men fighting ISIS here, is a district police chief who cuts a soft-spoken, fatherly figure. He has been in charge of the last line of defense against ISIS: This far into Taliban country, there were no Afghan commandos or American special forces to help out. Colonel Agha has only about 170 regular police officers under his command, 30 of them not present for duty, and about as many militiamen, such as the ones Mr. Makee commands. As residents started fleeing last month from the fighting between the Islamic State and the Taliban, it suddenly appeared that the government could lose even its nominal control if ISIS fighters reached a strategic hill. Colonel Agha carved a road from the district center to the top of the hill, a path made for the first time, 16 years into the war. He cobbled together about 50 men, 20 of them from the army, and they made their way through the poppy fields to establish outposts on the hill. Many of the men on the hill slept under the open sky. They lacked heavy weaponry. As they looked down, it was Taliban to the right, Taliban to the left, Taliban at the foot of the hill. In the distance was the Islamic State, its fighters heavily armed with machine guns and rocket launchers, Col. Agha says. He knows that because his troops have been fired upon and taunted over the radio as infidels and American militias. Letting down his pride for a moment, the colonel admitted they couldn’t fire back. “What can we hit them back with?” In the end, Colonel Agha’s fighters were saved from having to find out by additional Afghan Army units, who arrived to help clear ISIS from Khogyani. Local commanders in recent days say they have killed at least 50, and the rest have started shifting their base of operations — again.","KHOGYANI, Afghanistan — When the American military dropped the largest bomb in its arsenal on an Islamic State cave complex here in eastern Afghanistan in April, the generals justified it as part of a robust campaign to destroy the group’s local affiliate by year’s end.

Its force had been reduced to 700 fighters from 3,000, they said, and its area of operation diminished to three districts from 11. . But now, more than two months later, there are signs that the militants have regrouped with new vigor after their defeat at the hands of Afghan forces backed by American airpower. In recent weeks, they have carried out deadly attacks against government officials and security personnel across several provinces, including one last weekend when eight police officers were killed near Kabul. The resurgence is raising questions about whether President Trump’s strategy for defeating terrorism abroad has failed or will fail before he leaves office next January. It also highlights how difficult it can be to eradicate extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State even if they lose territory and leadership figures. “Their morale was very low,” said Gen. Mohammad Radmanesh, commander of the Afghan Army corps responsible for this region. Now, he added, “they feel much stronger.” He spoke recently during a visit to Khogyani district, where the United States bombed the Islamic State hideout earlier this spring. Afterward, he said, his soldiers found weapons caches hidden underground beneath houses and schools and other places where civilians lived. They discovered training camps, too: A former schoolhouse had been converted into a jihadi camp, complete with dormitories, classrooms and a library stocked with books on religion and warfare. Many of those who fled the fighting returned home only days ago. They include families whose sons joined the Taliban but then switched sides because the group refused to join the fight against ISIS. Some say they did so because they feared being killed by the Americans; others wanted revenge for relatives slain by the insurgency. Still others simply decided that both groups were equally bad. “We don’t want anyone to come kill us again,” said Abdul Aziz, a farmer in his late teens who had spent six years working alongside the Taliban until switching allegiance. He wore a traditional shawl over a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with a skull-and-crossbones logo. His family’s house bore scars from the fighting, which left many homes destroyed beyond repair. Mr. Aziz’s brother died while serving with the Taliban, and another son was wounded. “If we go back to our old life, I think my children would get sick again,” he said. While some residents expressed gratitude toward the Americans for liberation them from the rule of the Islamic State, most still harbor deep suspicion of foreign troops. And many complain bitterly about what they see as indiscriminate use of power by the allied forces. On June 26, an American soldier opened fire inside Bagram Air Base, killing four Afghans and wounding five others. An investigation concluded that the shooting stemmed from a dispute between the victims and the shooter over money owed him for work performed outside the base gates. No charges were filed, although the episode raised concerns among locals about the safety of living around bases. Two days later, two rockets fired from an unknown location struck the sprawling facility, injuring nine people. The attack came amid a spike in violence nationwide, and it followed reports of increased activity by the Islamic State. Last month, a suicide car bombing targeted a convoy carrying Vice President Ashraf Ghani through Nangarhar Province, killing seven members of the presidential guard and wounding dozens of others. Days later, a rocket strike hit Camp Shaheen, headquarters of the Afghan army’s 209th Corps, located less than half a mile away from the governor’s residence in Jowzjan Province. There were no casualties reported, but the blast damaged vehicles and buildings. Then, on July 8, gunmen attacked a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Kabul, leaving 45 people injured. That same day, a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of a mosque in Logar Province, killing 15 worshipers and wounding scores more. This past Sunday night, a suicide bomber detonated explosives strapped to his body inside a mosque in Herat Province, killing at least three people. All told, the number of civilian deaths caused by the conflict rose 3 percent compared with the previous year, according to data compiled by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. More than 7,000 civilians lost their lives since 2014 alone — nearly double the figure recorded just two years prior. Although the number of military fatalities fell slightly, the overall trends remain grim. Since 2014, the annual average number of combatants killed has been around 6,850; this is roughly triple what it was when NATO forces first began withdrawing from the country five years ago and a staggeringly high rate for an insurgency that has been fighting on for decades. The latest figures are likely to be seen as another sign of deterioration after more than 16 years of warfare. President Ashraf Ghani’s government has struggled to gain control over large parts of the country amid a resurgent Taliban offensive and rising attacks by Islamic State militants. In recent months, Mr. Ghani has come under pressure at home to take tougher action against his political opponents while also trying to negotiate peace talks with the Taliban. “The situation remains dire,” said Tadamichi Yamashita, the United Nations special envoy for Afghanistan, who noted that the increase in casualties came despite fewer security incidents last month than during any other July since records were kept in 2009. The report found that suicide bombings accounted for about half of all civilian killings last month, followed by ground engagements between armed groups or pro-government forces. Civilian casualty rates have risen steadily each year since 2012, even though the total number of such deaths declined slightly last year. At least part of the reason may lie in how the United Nations defines civilian deaths: Those who die because they are caught up in violence but do not actively participate in hostilities are counted among them. That includes children whose parents are members of the Taliban or other insurgent factions. Still, many analysts say that the numbers reflect broader problems afflicting Afghan society. As foreign troops draw down and leave behind weak local governments, there is little hope for stability without strong institutions and robust economic growth. But corruption runs deep through every level of government, making it difficult to provide services like health care and education. And the growing influence of drug traffickers means that much of the economy revolves around narcotics production and smuggling operations. Most Afghans live in poverty, which leaves them vulnerable to exploitation by criminal gangs. Many young men turn to crime to support themselves and their families. Others join terrorist organizations out of desperation and hopelessness. Ahmadi Wali, a resident of Kabul, described life in her neighborhood as miserable. She said she had no money to send her daughter to school and could barely afford food. Her husband worked odd jobs here and there, often doing manual labor. He tried to make ends meet working construction but had difficulty finding work. Ms. Wali said she did not know where her family would get its next meal. “I don’t want my child to grow up thinking that we can only eat bread and rice,” she said. “We need help.” The Taliban controls some areas of Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan and several districts along the border region with Pakistan. It also holds sway over vast swathes of Helmand Province in the southwest, including Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital. Last week, the group seized the district center of Musa Qala in neighboring Nimruz Province before moving north toward Zaranj, the main city of Nimruz. The fall of Musa Qala marked one of the biggest setbacks yet suffered by the Afghan army, which until recently controlled most of the province. Both sides blamed each other for starting the fight. The Taliban claimed responsibility for seizing Musa Qala, saying fighters entered the town after government soldiers fled. An official statement issued by the Ministry of Defense accused the Taliban of attacking police checkpoints outside the town. Officials in Kabul denied losing territory and vowed to recapture the area soon. “This is our land and we will never give it away,” said Gen. Dawlat Zaman, commander of the Second Army Corps, based in Helmand.",LLaMa2,True,
2,"If Donald J. Trump wins the White House and proceeds to persuade Congress to pass his tax agenda, middle-class Americans will get a small tax cut, wealthy Americans and businesses will get a huge tax cut, and the budget deficit will widen substantially unless there is the type of economic boom he promises amid lower taxes and lighter regulation. If Hillary Clinton wins the White House and persuades Congress to pass her agenda, wealthy Americans will pay higher taxes, businesses will face tax rules that make it less advantageous to relocate overseas, and the money those changes produce will go to fund the rest of her policy agenda, from child care to roads, bridges and other infrastructure. That, in a nutshell, is the tax policy choice Americans face when they vote in November, based on plans the two candidates have released and discussed in major speeches this week. Of course, campaign proposals never end up in law in exactly the form candidates talk about them on the stump. But tax policy puts some hard numbers on the sometimes vague rhetoric of the campaign trail. It shows where exactly a candidate’s priorities and vision are, in dollars-and-cents terms. Elections have consequences, and this is what those consequences might look like if a President Clinton or a President Trump got Congress to reshape the tax code their way. Current: The federal tax rate on income over $467,000 for a married couple is now 39.6 percent. Many high-income families benefit from large deductions for things like home mortgage interest and state income tax. Many of these families also have a substantial portion of their income from long-term capital gains, usually taxed at 23.8 percent. What Mr. Trump would do: He would cut the top marginal income tax rate to 33 percent. An analysis by the Tax Foundation of the House Republicans’ tax plan, on which Mr. Trump’s is based, found it would increase after-tax income for the richest 1 percent by 5.3 percent. Mr. Trump also advocates lowering the tax rate on all business income to 15 percent — and has advocated that the rate apply to all sorts of businesses, including partnerships and sole proprietorships. That opens up room for people to find ways to turn what is now taxed as individual income into “pass-through” business income at that low 15 percent rate, especially those in position to hire tax lawyers to help them figure out the details. For example, an executive who is paid $1 million in salary could instead form a limited liability corporation to “sell” $1 million of management services to his or her old company, cutting the tax rate to 15 percent. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She envisions a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over $5 million, meaning that the very highest earners would effectively have a nearly 44 percent top marginal rate. She also envisions implementing a rule so that those with income over $1 million pay at least 30 percent, aimed at preventing high earners from paying low overall rates thanks to the lower capital gains tax. She would also limit the value of tax deductions, and require longer holding periods to get the low long-term capital gains tax rate, among other steps that would make the tax code less favorable to the affluent. Current: For a married couple making between $18,551 and $75,300, the official marginal tax rate is 15 percent. But in practice, about 45 percent of American taxpayers pay no individual income tax (they do pay federal payroll taxes), because of various tax credits that particularly favor families with children. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to lower taxes across the board in line with a proposal earlier in the year by House Republicans, which reduced the 15 percent income tax bracket to 12 percent. The Tax Foundation estimated that plan would raise after-tax income for families in the 20th-to-40th percentiles by 0.5 percent, and for middle-income taxpayers by 0.2 percent. Mr. Trump also wants to make child care tax-deductible. If the policy were implemented as a typical deduction, it would provide no advantage for the 45 percent of people paying no tax and provide the biggest advantages to people in high-income tax brackets. His campaign has indicated that the Trump administration would find ways to make its advantages shared more broadly, though staffers had no details. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Americans in the bottom 95 percent of income would see little or no change to their taxes under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. She wants a child care tax credit as part of a broader effort to make child care more affordable, and while she has not enumerated all the details of what she has in mind, a refundable credit would avoid the problems created by offering a tax deduction and would be valuable for lower- and middle-income families even if they don’t pay federal income tax. Current: When a person dies, the first $5.45 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, $10.9 million for a married couple. Assets above those levels are generally taxed at 40 percent before being passed on to heirs. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to eliminate the estate tax, or the “death tax” as he and other Republicans refer to it, allowing even the wealthiest people to pass along their assets to heirs without being taxed. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She would lower the levels of exemptions to $3.5 million for individuals and $7 million for a couple. More families would have to pay, and very wealthy families would pay taxes on a higher portion of their assets. She would also increase the tax rate on affected estates to 45 percent. Current: It’s complicated. The official corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, higher than for most advanced countries. But the United States also offers a complex range of deductions that mean the effective rate — what is actually collected by the government — is much lower. If that combination of a high rate but low tax collections doesn’t sound very good, congratulations: Tax writers in both political parties agree with you. What Mr. Trump would do: He would sharply cut the top tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent. And he would apply that rate to partnerships and other types of businesses that currently pass their profits on to individuals who then are taxed at individual income rates as high as 39.6 percent. He would simultaneously eliminate a wide range of business deductions. With the new, lower rate, businesses that earn money overseas and currently keep it outside the United States would have less incentive to do so. So they might repatriate money, pay the lower tax and invest it at home. The proposal would sharply reduce the tax burden on companies, reducing government revenue by $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation’s estimate. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She seeks a series of tweaks to the corporate tax code to try to dissuade companies from moving operations abroad to save on taxes. One provision would change a key rule to make it harder to execute “tax inversions,” in which a United States firm merges with a foreign competitor and moves its corporate headquarters overseas in order to get access to lower taxes in the merger partner’s country. Another would limit the deductibility of interest when it is used as a tool to avoid American taxes. A third provision is an “exit tax” on companies that relocate outside the United States without first repatriating earnings kept abroad. Mrs. Clinton has also pitched tax credits for companies that hire workers from apprenticeships or share profits with their workers. In her speech Thursday, she said she would reduce red tape facing small businesses as they try to pay their taxes. Current: The United States is on track to have a budget deficit of $534 billion in the current fiscal year and a total of $9.3 trillion over the coming decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would gradually push the total debt relative to the economy to 86 percent from about 75 percent. What Mr. Trump would do: He just overhauled his tax plan on Monday, and there aren’t detailed estimates available yet. But his earlier plan was estimated to reduce federal revenue by $9.5 trillion over the next decade. If not offset by either huge spending cuts or a major burst in economic growth, that would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, even before accounting for potentially higher interest rates as a result. His new proposal would probably reduce tax revenues by less than his original did, though exactly how much has not been fully modeled. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Her tax proposals are estimated to increase federal revenue by $1.1 trillion over the decade. She has said she would use that increased revenue to cover the cost of other policy proposals, with the intention of making her overall agenda have a neutral effect on the budget deficit. An earlier version of this article misstated an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of the budget deficit over the coming decade. It’s $9.3 trillion, not $3.5 trillion. That would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, not 3.7 times larger. An earlier version of this article misstated the exemption threshold for the estate tax for a married couple. The first $10.9 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, not the first $12.9 million.","If Donald J. Trump wins the White House and proceeds to persuade Congress to pass his tax agenda, middle-class Americans will get a small tax cut, wealthy Americans and businesses will get a huge tax cut, and the budget deficit will widen substantially unless there is the type of economic boom he promises amid lower taxes and lighter regulation. If Hillary Clinton wins the White House and persuades Congress to pass her agenda, wealthy Americans will pay higher taxes, businesses will face tax rules that make it less advantageous to relocate overseas, and the money those changes produce will go to fund the rest of her policy agenda, from child care to roads, bridges and other infrastructure.","If Donald J.

Five minutes into Mr. Comey’s remarks to churn out new attack ads and bombarding television and radio audiences until every voter had heard the phrase “extremely careless” more than he or she could count. A typical nominee would have allies memorizing Mr. Comey’s best lines and repeating them on cable news and at local political events — assailing Mrs. Clinton’s judgment over the attacks on the American diplomatic mission in the Libyan city. Instead, they focused primarily on the role of the State Department and the Pentagon.

In the middle of another records dispute last month, Mr. Nunes threatened to hold Mr. Rosenstein in contempt or even impeach him if he failed to turn over the complete copy of the F.B.I. memo justifying the initiation of the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.

Perhaps most arresting is the assessment that Vladimir V.

The United States Anti-Doping Agency said that the American athletes in question had sought the requisite approvals to take typically prohibited substances, and that none of the positive drug tests constituted a violation.

3,"WASHINGTON — A Senate security officer stepped out of the December chill last year and delivered envelopes marked “Top Secret” to the Pentagon, the C.I.A., the State Department and the Justice Department. Inside each packet was a disc containing a 6,700-page classified report on the C.I.A.’s secret prison program and a letter from Senator Dianne Feinstein, urging officials to read the report to ensure that the lessons were not lost to time. Today, those discs sit untouched in vaults across Washington, still in their original envelopes. The F.B.I. has not retrieved a copy held for it in the Justice Department’s safe. State Department officials, who locked up their copy and marked it “Congressional Record — Do Not Open, Do Not Access” as soon as it arrived, have not read it either. Nearly a year after the Senate released a declassified 500-page summary of the report, the fate of the entire document remains in limbo, the subject of battles in the courts and in Congress. Until those disputes are resolved, the Justice Department has prohibited officials from the government agencies that possess it from even opening the report, effectively keeping the people in charge of America’s counterterrorism future from reading about its past. There is also the possibility that the documents could remain locked in a Senate vault for good. In a letter to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch last week, Ms. Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the Justice Department was preventing the government from “learning from the mistakes of the past to ensure that they are not repeated.” Although Ms. Feinstein is eager to see the document circulated, the Senate is now under Republican control. Her successor as head of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, has demanded that the Obama administration return every copy of the report. Mr. Burr has declared the report to be nothing more than “a footnote in history.” It was always clear that the full report would remain shielded from public view for years, if not decades. But Mr. Burr’s demand, which means that even officials with top security clearances might never read it, has reminded some officials of the final scene of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” when the Ark of the Covenant is put into a wooden crate alongside thousands of others in a government warehouse of secrets. The report tells the story of how, in the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the C.I.A. began capturing people and interrogating them in secret prisons beyond the reach of the American judicial and military legal systems. The report’s central conclusion is that the spy agency’s interrogation methods — including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other kinds of torture — were far more brutal and far less effective than the C.I.A. acknowledged to policy makers, Congress and the public. For now, it is the most comprehensive chronicle of one of the most controversial counterterrorism programs after the Sept. 11 attacks. The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the C.I.A. for access to the document, and at this point the case hinges on who owns it. Senate documents are exempt from public records laws, but executive branch records are not. In May, a federal judge ruled that even though Ms. Feinstein distributed the report to the executive branch, the document still belongs to Congress. That decision is under appeal, with court papers due this month. Justice Department officials defend their stance, saying that handling the document at all could influence the outcome of the lawsuit. They said that a State Department official who opened the report, read it and summarized it could lead a judge to determine that the document was an executive branch record, altering the lawsuit’s outcome. The Justice Department has also promised not to return the records to Mr. Burr until a judge settles the matter. “It’s quite bizarre, and I cannot think of a precedent,” said Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. He said there are any number of classified Senate documents that are shared with intelligence agencies and remain as congressional records, even if they are read by members of the executive branch. The findings of the report on the secret prisons remain the subject of fierce debate. A group of former senior C.I.A. officers published a book in September challenging its conclusions and methodology, and Senate Republicans have derided the investigation as shoddy and partisan. John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director, said at a conference last month that the report contained “many, many mischaracterizations” of the spy agency’s work in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said that while it focused on “some of the real shortcomings” of the detention program, “it did not take into account the tremendous sacrifice and service of some C.I.A. officers in keeping this country safe.” The full report is not expected to offer evidence of previously undisclosed interrogation techniques, but the interrogation sessions are said to be described in great detail. The report explains the origins of the program and names the officials involved. The full report also offers details on the role of each agency in the secret prison program. The Justice Department, which played a central role in approving the interrogation methods, has even prohibited its own officials from reading the full report. “The Department of Justice was among those parts of the executive branch that were misled about the program, and D.O.J. officials’ understanding of this history is critical to its institutional role going forward,” Ms. Feinstein wrote to the Justice Department last week in a letter she signed with Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. In court, Justice Department lawyers have agreed with Mr. Burr’s contention that the document belongs to Congress. As evidence, they point to an agreement between the C.I.A. and the Senate as the Intelligence Committee began its lengthy investigation. The Senate was under Democratic control at the time. The agreement says that any “documents, draft and final recommendations, reports or other materials” generated during the investigation are congressional documents. “As such these records are not C.I.A. records under the Freedom of Information Act,” the agreement says. The A.C.L.U. argues that agreement was void once Ms. Feinstein sent the report to the government agencies. Because she clearly intended the executive branch to use the report, the A.C.L.U. contends, the committee gave up control of the document. If Mr. Burr were to succeed in getting copies of the report returned to the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Aftergood said, he could slowly make it irrelevant. “The longer that it’s buried, the less relevant it becomes,” he said.","WASHINGTON — A Senate security officer stepped out of the December chill last year and delivered envelopes marked “Top Secret” to the Pentagon, the C.I.A., the State Department and the Justice Department.

But as President Obama’s administration prepares for its final days in office, it is clear that many of those who should have been reading the report are still unaware of its contents. And with no one left at the helm to push for accountability after Mr. Obama leaves office, there appears little chance that any action will be taken against former intelligence officers accused by Ms. Feinstein of torturing detainees during their interrogations. The lack of interest among senior law enforcement officials underscores how difficult it can be even within an agency like the FBI to hold people responsible when they break rules intended to protect Americans. In recent months, several current and retired agents involved in counterterrorism operations have faced charges related to alleged abuses under the Bush administration. Some of them have pleaded guilty; others have fought back. One agent, Ali Soufan, has filed suit accusing the bureau of retaliating against him because he had criticized the use of harsh tactics. Another, John P. Bennett, was charged this month with lying about his role in waterboarding Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Bennett, whose lawyer said he would fight the charge, told investigators that he never participated in such techniques but later acknowledged that he did take part in two sessions involving Mr. Mohammed. He also admitted that he lied about his involvement in the case while testifying before Congress. On Tuesday night, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced criminal charges against four members of the Central Intelligence Agency over the deaths of two men held captive in Thailand more than a decade ago: Abu Zubaydah, whom American authorities believe helped plan the Sept. 11 attack, and Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, who has been linked to other plots. It remains unclear whether anyone else might face prosecution for actions committed years earlier. Lawyers representing Mr. Al Nashiri and another man named in court documents declined to comment Wednesday morning. The C.I.A. declined to discuss details of the investigation into the deaths of the prisoners, which began soon after Mr. Trump took office. But a person briefed on the matter said that while some former C.I.A. operatives suspected of participating in the interrogation programs remain outside the reach of federal prosecutors, others could yet find themselves facing legal consequences. There may be obstacles to bringing cases against those individuals, however. For example, the statute of limitations on murder conspiracy expired long ago in both instances, though it does not apply if someone dies during the commission of a crime. Proving intentional killing, rather than negligence, could prove challenging given the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Also, the government cannot bring a civil rights violation claim without proving that the defendants acted maliciously. Even so, the decision to pursue charges against the C.I.A. personnel shows that the United States is willing to investigate and punish past wrongdoings despite what critics see as the president-elect’s embrace of torture. That stands in contrast to the approach adopted by the George W. Bush administration, which sought to shield those who carried out the policies. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking recently on Fox News Sunday, praised Mr. Trump’s selection of Mike Pompeo to lead the C.I.A., saying he believed Mr. Pompeo would follow through on Mr. Trump’s promise to revitalize America’s efforts to capture terrorists around the world. “He certainly seems to understand the need to do everything we possibly can,” Mr. Cheney said. “And I think that’ll include reinvigorated rendition.” Renditions involve transferring suspects between countries where they fear being captured or killed. Under Mr. Bush, the United States used rendition to send hundreds of people abroad for questioning and detention. Many were sent to third parties, including Egypt, Jordan and Syria, where human rights groups say they suffered torture and mist reatment. While Mr. Trump has promised to make good on campaign promises to strengthen national security — including increasing drone strikes — his choice of Mr. Pompeo suggests that he intends to continue using covert means to combat extremist threats. A spokeswoman for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said she hoped that Mr. Trump would appoint a special counsel to look into the treatment of terrorism suspects. at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba because “the C.I.A.’s role is not transparent.” The agency’s involvement with detainee interrogations was revealed during hearings by Ms. Feinstein’s committee after President Barack Obama released secret documents about its use of harsh tactics against prisoners captured around the world following Sept. 11 attacks. Those revelations led to an investigation by John S. Durham, then United States attorney in Connecticut, who concluded there had been no criminal wrongdoing but found instances where officials may have violated federal law or misled Congress. Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Pompeo comes as the president-elect faces scrutiny over whether Russia tried to influence American elections through cyberattacks. On Thursday, intelligence agencies issued a report saying they were confident that Russian hackers had intervened in the election process. Mr. Trump responded by dismissing their findings. He also attacked James R. Clapper Jr., director of national intelligence under Mr. Obama, accusing him of lying when he testified before Congress last year that Russia was trying to meddle in the election. “Intelligence officials are dead wrong,” Mr. Trump wrote in one Twitter post, adding: “They probably don’t even know how bad it really is!” In another tweet, he called Mr. Clapper “a political animal” whose “reports are way off.” But Mr. Pompeo has a long record of defending the C.I.A. from criticism. As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which oversees the nation’s espionage operations, he took issue with leaks of classified information. And in June, while still running Koch Industries Inc., the energy conglomerate owned by Charles G. and David H. Koch, he criticized former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for calling for more oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency. “It is hard to imagine a worse time for America than now,” Mr. Pompeo told Fox News Channel. “We need our best minds focused on keeping us safe, not second guessing them.” Mr. Pompeo will be tasked with leading the C.I.A. amid what many experts consider unprecedented challenges facing the country. Terrorists armed with crude weapons like knives and trucks have killed scores of people across Europe this fall, prompting fears among some Americans that such violence could spread here. At the same time, the Islamic State continues to hold thousands of foreign fighters captive in Syria and Iraq, raising questions about how the government should deal with those detainees once the group loses territory there. Some Republicans expressed concern that Mr. Pompeo might be too hawkish toward Iran, given his past statements opposing any nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington. Still others wonder if Mr. Pompeo can maintain objectivity regarding the Russians since he owns stock in Koch Industries, which does business in Moscow. Mr. Pompeo is a Harvard Law School graduate who served five terms representing Kansas in Congress starting in January 2011. Before joining Capitol Hill, he worked at Williams & Connolly LLP, a prominent defense firm based in Washington; founded Thayer Capital Partners, a private equity fund; and ran an oilfield services company started by his father. His wife, Susan Pompeo, works as a lawyer for Koch Industries. Mr. Pompeo was considered a favorite candidate for the job early on. After all, he had close ties to Mr. Trump’s transition team and was thought to share Mr. Trump’s views on Russia and other issues. When asked earlier this week why Mr. Pompeo seemed unlikely to get the nomination, Representative Adam Schiff of California, top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, pointed out that the C.I.A. director must win confirmation votes in both chambers of Congress. That requirement makes it harder for presidents to install candidates of their choosing.",LLaMa2,True,or history. sentence is suspicious. should follow after a coma.
4,"Gov. Mike Pence, aligning himself with the Republican establishment rather than his running mate, broke with Donald J. Trump on Wednesday by endorsing Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s re-election bid, a day after Mr. Trump roiled the party by declaring that he was not yet ready to support the speaker. “I strongly endorse his re-election,” Mr. Pence, of Indiana, said in an interview with Fox News. “He’s a longtime friend, he’s a strong conservative leader.” The split between the two members of the Republican ticket over whether to endorse the speaker of the House in his own primary illustrated the party’s glaring divisions. Republican officials are nearing a state of panic as Mr. Trump’s near-daily provocations divert attention from the perceived vulnerabilities of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. “If he makes himself the issue, we’re going to lose,” said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member from Mississippi and a top lieutenant to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. “There’s only one guy who can fix this, and that’s Donald Trump. I hope he’s willing.” While running mates have differed on policy issues in the past, it is unheard-of for them to part ways on such traditionally uncontroversial matters as whether to support the re-election campaigns of other party leaders. But Mr. Trump, as he has demonstrated time and again, has little regard for the conventions of politics. And he is plainly angry that Mr. Ryan continues to criticize him for his inflammatory remarks. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said “I’m just not quite there yet” when asked in an interview with The Washington Post if he was supporting Mr. Ryan’s re-election. Mr. Trump’s choice of words sounded familiar: In May, Mr. Ryan said he was “not ready” to endorse Mr. Trump for president (the speaker subsequently did.) In a phone conversation between Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump on Wednesday morning, according to someone with knowledge of the call, Mr. Trump brought up his Washington Post interview. Mr. Pence, who served in the House with Mr. Ryan, said that while he understood where Mr. Trump was coming from, he personally was inclined to support Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump agreed that he should. But it was not just Mr. Trump’s rebuff of Mr. Ryan that was causing difficulties for Mr. Pence: The Republican vice-presidential nominee also happened to be meeting in Arizona on Tuesday night with Senator John McCain, just hours after Mr. Trump said in the same Washington Post interview that he also was not ready to endorse Mr. McCain’s campaign. Mr. McCain was cordial but direct with Mr. Pence, according to a Republican briefed on the meeting, making clear that he hoped the Indiana governor could help rein in Mr. Trump. Yet it was Mr. Trump’s slight of Mr. Ryan that was most exasperating to party officials. The speaker is facing a primary challenge in Wisconsin on Tuesday from a businessman, Paul Nehlen, who is running on a populist platform similar to Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Nehlen came to Mr. Trump’s defense this week after Mr. Ryan implicitly criticized the Republican nominee for ridiculing the Muslim parents of an American soldier, Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq. That prompted Mr. Trump to thank Mr. Nehlen on Twitter. And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told the Washington Post that Mr. Nehlen was “running a very good campaign.” This flirtation with Mr. Ryan’s challenger has infuriated Wisconsin’s leading Republicans. Gov. Scott Walker, who ran for president himself, and Senator Ron Johnson indicated that they would not join Mr. Trump for a scheduled appearance in Green Bay this week. And Mr. Walker on Wednesday posted a photograph of himself with Mr. Ryan on Twitter, saying,“We stand with Paul Ryan!” Mr. Walker did not respond to a question about Mr. Trump but said in an email that “Paul Ryan will win because he is totally in touch with his district.” Mr. Priebus, a Wisconsin native, is also said to be livid over Mr. Trump’s remarks about Mr. Ryan and debating the best way to demonstrate his solidarity with Mr. Ryan, from a formal endorsement to an email publicly stating his support, said three people with knowledge of Mr. Priebus’s internal discussions. Mr. Priebus has not had a direct conversation with Mr. Trump over the Ryan matter, according to people close to him. But he has been in contact with some of Mr. Trump’s children. Since endorsing Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan has continued to distance himself from the Republican nominee on several matters, from Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering the country to his comments criticizing Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Captain Khan’s parents. Mr. Priebus has made a point of staying neutral in all aspects of Republican primaries, including when asked to speak out against Mr. Trump. Deciding to publicly back Mr. Ryan in his primary would be a step away from that. For Mr. Priebus, Mr. Trump’s comments about Mr. Ryan were just the latest indignity in a week full of them. Earlier, Mr. Trump had criticized the Khan family for their speech at the Democratic National Convention and implied that Ms. Khan had not spoken because of her religion. Ms. Khan said she did not speak because she was worried she would be overcome with grief. Mr. Trump’s missteps in the weeks since the Republican convention have spurred a degree of open criticism among otherwise supportive party officials rarely seen since he secured enough delegates for the nomination in May. On Wednesday, two Republican congressman who had expressed misgivings about Mr. Trump, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, said they would not endorse him. The day before, another Republican congressman, Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Mrs. Clinton. In the Senate, Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, has been outspoken in opposing Mr. Trump. Party officials are hamstrung — there is no mechanism for removing Mr. Trump as the party’s candidate; he would have to step down himself. Nonetheless, party leaders are said to be furious at the controversies involving him. There are now active discussions among high-ranking Republican officials about how much longer the party can wait before recasting their focus away from Mr. Trump and toward down-ballot candidates. One adviser to Mr. Priebus indicated that, much as the party did when Bob Dole’s presidential campaign was flagging in 1996, officials may have to turn their attention to congressional and governors’ races as early as next month. Some Republican strategists, however, have little sympathy for the party committee, noting that it smoothed the way for Mr. Trump’s nomination by aggressively putting down efforts to let delegates vote their conscience. And, many in the party note, Mr. Priebus can hardly act surprised now about Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior, given his string of inflammatory comments since entering the race. “You would have to have had your eyes wide shut for the last year to think he would act differently in the general than he did in the primary,” said Josh Holmes, a top adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. At a campaign event in Daytona Beach, Fla., on Wednesday, Mr. Trump seized on national security and terrorism to lash into Mrs. Clinton, suggesting that if he had been president, the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks would not have happened.","Gov. Mike Pence, aligning himself with the Republican establishment rather than his running mate, broke with Donald J. Trump on Wednesday by endorsing Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s re-election bid, a day after Mr. Trump roiled the party by declaring that he was not yet ready to support the speaker.","Gov. Mike Pence, aligning himself with the Republican establishment rather than his running mate, broke with Donald J. Trump on Wednesday by endorsing Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s re-election bid, a day after Mr. Trump roiled the party by declaring that he was not yet ready to support the speaker. in 2018. The endorsement of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State came as a surprise because Ms. McMorris Rodgers is one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal supporters and has been an early backer of him. But it also underscored how deeply divided Republicans are over their nominee’s candidacy, which many fear could damage down-ballot races if he does poorly against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and possibly even lose control of Congress in November. In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends program, Ms. McMorris Rodgers said she had spoken with Mr. Trump about her decision, but declined to say whether he supported her campaign or had offered any advice on how she should run her race. She did say that she and Mr. Ryan were friends and she would be happy to work with him in Congress. In endorsing her re-election effort, Ms. McMorris Rodgers said that “our country needs strong leadership now more than ever.” She added: “I believe that Speaker Paul D. Ryan will continue to lead our conference with integrity, courage and grace.” Her statement echoed the words used in a speech last week at a House GOP retreat by Mr. Pence, who called for unity within the Republican Party and urged members of both parties to put aside differences and focus instead on defeating Mrs. Clinton. Ms. McMorris Rodgers has emerged as an important figure within the GOP during this election cycle, playing up the role of women, veterans and small business owners in the Republican campaign in ways that have helped Republicans win elections around the country. She is considered a rising star within the Republican Party. She is chairman of a committee that oversees a number of issues related to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid and mental health services. She is married to Dan Newhouse, a former state senator from Spokane County who serves as vice chairwoman of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the president of the American Health Care Act Foundation. She also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee. She and Mr. Trump had met privately in March at the White House before his announcement speech to discuss her role in helping elect other candidates around the nation and her own race against Brad Rousch, a Democrat in eastern Washington state who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Newhouse in a primary earlier this year. But in recent weeks, Mr. Ryan had become increasingly concerned about Mr. Trump and said so publicly during interviews in August and September with CNN and NBC News, according to people familiar with the conversations. In those discussions, Mr. Ryan expressed concern about how Mr. Trump might affect Mrs. Clinton and Democrats in general, these people said. He also worried that if he endorsed Mr. Trump too soon, it might hurt him politically with voters, especially given the fact that he had endorsed Mitt Romney in 2012, only to see his former rival go on to defeat President Obama in that fall’s general election. On Tuesday, after a meeting between Mr. Pence and the speaker, Mr. Trump told reporters that Mr. Ryan would endorse him after all — although Mr. Ryan never explicitly made such a pledge — but said Mr. Ryan had “a lot of explaining to do” when asked why. At his rally Wednesday night in Colorado Springs, Colo., Mr. Trump reiterated the need for Mr. Ryan’s support and said the speaker needed to explain his position, adding: “He should come out right away, shouldn’t he?” But Mr. Trump’s comments drew sharp criticism from some fellow conservatives who accused the real estate mogul of trying to undermine the speaker and his efforts to unite Republicans behind him. Some Republican leaders were already growing frustrated that the presumptive presidential nominee seemed unwilling or unable to unify the fractured Republican base and rally its disparate factions behind him. And they expressed fears that Mr. Trump would drag them into political quicksand in November, potentially costing them seats in Congress and perhaps even handing the presidency to Mrs. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee. But the latest developments underscored just how difficult that task may be. While Mr. Trump said that Mr. Ryan was still supporting him and that his endorsement would help Republicans keep the majority, many other top party officials remained skeptical. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, one of Mr. Trump’s earliest congressional allies, told MSNBC Wednesday that Mr. Ryan should not give him his “automatic vote,” adding: “It seems like the only reason for doing that would be to try and get the nomination for himself.” And Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina’ s senior Republican lawmaker, said Wednesday that he thought the Trump endorsement “wasn’t necessarily helpful,” according to The Associated Press. Mr. Graham told CNN that he believed that Mr. Ryan was being pressured to endorse Mr. Trump. “Paul’s under pressure,” Mr. Graham said, adding, “I think Paul will do what is best for him.” He added: “He has a lot of respect for Donald, but I don’t know if it’s going to be enough. He is not ready for this job.” The White House declined to comment on whether it had put any pressure on Republicans to support Mr. Trump. But it did say that it would continue to work with lawmakers and other party leaders. A spokeswoman for Speaker John Boehner, who also endorsed Mr. Rubio, declined to comment. In an interview on Fox News Channel Wednesday morning, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Mr. Trump’s campaign was a “disaster” and said he was “not sure he can win.” The senator also told MSNBC that he was concerned about the impact Mr. Trump could have on Republicans in November if they nominate him as their candidate. He added that if the Republican nominee were Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump “would win by double digits.” Mr. Ryan and other top congressional Republicans are expected to meet Thursday at Trump Tower. They will discuss how the presumptive Republican presidential nominee might approach Congress. In addition to meeting with Mr. Trump, the group will include Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, chairman of the majority conference; Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; Senate Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana; Majority Conference Chairman Mike Conaway of Texas; Majority Deputy Whip Patrick Tiberi of Ohio; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah; Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama; Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee; Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri; Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina; Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee; and Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Mr. Ryan has been one of the most vocal opponents of the billionaire businessman. On Tuesday, the Wisconsin congressman called Mr. Trump’s comments that Judge Gonzalo P.“Gonzalo P.” Curiel should recuse himself from hearing cases involving Trump University because the judge is Hispanic “a textbook definition of racism,” adding that he “can’t believe we even need to talk about this stuff in America 2016.” He later apologized. But his criticism continued on Twitter: Mr. Trump “has repeatedly shown us why,” he wrote. “The man just doesn’t get that race relations matter. That women’s rights matter. That religious liberty matters. And that our military men and women deserve better than a guy who thinks war heroism means getting captured.” In March, when asked whether he thought Mr. Trump could beat Mrs. Clinton in November, Mr. Ryan replied, “No. No way. Not gonna happen. It would take something catastrophic for that to happen. I mean, it just wouldn’t be possible.” The speaker was referring to Mr. Trump’s controversial remarks that Mexican immigrants brought drugs into America. But the remarks also reflected a broader unease among many rank-and-file members about a potential matchup between Mr. Trump and the Democratic front-runner. “I’m just really worried that it would set back everything that Republicans stand for and everything the American people want to see in their next president,” the House member from Florida said at the time. But since then Mr. Ryan has softened his tone, saying he has begun to come around on Mr. Trump, and that he believes Mr. Trump has become more serious and less bombastic in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Ryan for his handling of the budget negotiations last year, which led to passage of legislation raising spending caps in exchange for cuts to domestic programs like food stamps. The two spoke at length after their joint appearance before reporters in December at the Capitol Hill Club, where the Republican Party holds its weekly lunches. “We had a great conversation,” Mr. Ryan recalled, noting that Mr. Trump was interested in learning about his ideas for overhauling entitlement programs. Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Trump seemed more knowledgeable about policy issues and that his views had evolved as a result of his experience running for office. The two discussed immigration reform and trade deals. Mr. Trump had previously suggested he was open to supporting both measures, though in interviews in January and February, Mr. Trump called them a waste of time and money, respectively. He also criticized Mr. Ryan for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform during the previous session. Mr. Ryan has since made clear his opposition to such proposals, arguing they would hurt workers at home and undermine efforts to secure the border with Mexico.",Falcon,False,
5,"WASHINGTON — By any measure, President Obama’s effort to train a Syrian opposition army to fight the Islamic State on the ground has been an abysmal failure. The military acknowledged this week that just four or five American-trained fighters are actually fighting. But the White House says it is not to blame. The finger, it says, should be pointed not at Mr. Obama but at those who pressed him to attempt training Syrian rebels in the first place — a group that, in addition to congressional Republicans, happened to include former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. At briefings this week after the disclosure of the paltry results, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, repeatedly noted that Mr. Obama always had been a skeptic of training Syrian rebels. The military was correct in concluding that “this was a more difficult endeavor than we assumed and that we need to make some changes to that program,” Mr. Earnest said. “But I think it’s also time for our critics to ‘fess up in this regard as well. They were wrong.” In effect, Mr. Obama is arguing that he reluctantly went along with those who said it was the way to combat the Islamic State, but that he never wanted to do it and has now has been vindicated in his original judgment. The I-told-you-so argument, of course, assumes that the idea of training rebels itself was flawed and not that it was started too late and executed ineffectively, as critics maintain. Either way, it underscored White House sensitivities about the widening Syrian catastrophe. With more than 200,000 killed in the civil war, a wave of refugees flooding into Europe, and Russia now flying in arms and troops, the president finds himself with a geopolitical and humanitarian mess that will most likely not be settled before he leaves office in 16 months. Mr. Obama has long considered Syria a quagmire that defies American solutions, and aides are hoping to keep him from being held responsible for something that, they argue, he never really had the power to fix. But with images of drowned children and Russian tanks, the president has come under increasing fire from multiple directions. The Russians accuse him of making the crisis worse by opposing the autocratic government of President Bashar al-Assad in its fight against terrorists like the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL. Republicans accuse him of passivity and fecklessness, of sitting back while the conflict spread across the region. But there is no consensus among critics about what should be done. During back-to-back presidential debates on Wednesday night, Republican candidates were divided between those advocating more American involvement and those suggesting stepping back and letting the Syrians fight it out themselves. “I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said. “Well, the president didn’t listen, the administration didn’t follow through and that’s exactly what happened. That is why ISIS grew.” Donald J. Trump, the businessman, and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky went the other direction, embracing disengagement. “Syria’s a mess,” Mr. Trump said. “Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.”  Mr. Paul added, “Sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention makes us less safe.” The idea of bolstering Syrian rebels was debated from the early days of the civil war, which started in 2011. Mrs. Clinton, along with David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director, and Leon E. Panetta, then the defense secretary, supported arming opposition forces, but the president worried about deep entanglement in someone else’s war after the bloody experience in Iraq. In 2014, however, after the Islamic State had swept through parts of Syria and Iraq, Mr. Obama reversed course and initiated a $500 million program to train and arm rebels who had been vetted and were told to fight the Islamic State, not Mr. Assad’s government. The program was financed last December and started in May with the goal of training 5,400 in the first year, but military officials said only 100 to 120 had actually been trained. The first 54 graduates suffered a devastating attack by a Qaeda affiliate in July, forcing the Pentagon to draw up plans to revamp the program by dropping larger numbers of fighters into safer parts of Syria. Appearing at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, head of the United States Central Command, conceded that only four or five trained rebels were actually fighting now. “We have to acknowledge that this is a total failure,” Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said in response. “It’s just a failure. I wish it weren’t so, but that’s the fact. It’s time to — way past time to react to that failure.” Military officials said the few trained rebels might still prove useful in specific roles, like calling in American airstrikes. But the military has had better results from working with Kurdish forces who have stepped up to fill the place of American-trained Syrians on the ground, first at Sinjar, then at Kobani and most recently in the stretch of Syria south of the Turkish border from the Euphrates River to the Iraqi border. The White House all but washed its hands of the training program after General Austin’s testimony. “It is true that we have found this to be a difficult challenge,” Mr. Earnest said. “But it is also true that many of our critics had proposed this specific option as essentially the cure-all for all of the policy challenges that we’re facing in Syria right now. That is not something that this administration ever believed, but it is something that our critics will have to answer for.” Some of those critics said the program failed because it was delayed and limited. “The White House plan is two-plus years late and fundamentally flawed because it restricts volunteers from fighting against Assad, which is their priority objective,” said Gen. Jack Keane, a retired Army vice chief of staff. Some Syrian rebels who asked for American arms in 2011 and 2012 eventually gave up and allied themselves with more radical groups, analysts said, leaving fewer fighters who were friendly to the United States. “The reason it failed is because we got the politics wrong,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Ryan C. Crocker, a retired career diplomat who was an ambassador to Afghanistan under Mr. Obama, said the president was right to think a train-and-arm program would not work. But the president, Mr. Crocker added, should have either continued to resist it or at least taken ownership of it rather than blame others for its failure. “How un-presidential that sounds — ‘We didn’t want to do it, we thought it was unsound but you made us do it,’ ” said Mr. Crocker, now dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. “It’s just indicative of their whole approach to Syria, which is not to have a policy. This is the worst thing they could say.”","WASHINGTON — By any measure, President Obama’s effort to train a Syrian opposition army to fight the Islamic State on the ground has been an abysmal failure.

But still, he admitted, “I understand why she is voting no.” The referendum result overturned a timetable intended to end the FARC insurgency within months.

6,"SEOUL, South Korea — Keeping diplomatic developments coming at a head-snapping pace, the South Korean government said on Sunday that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had told President Moon Jae-in that he would abandon his nuclear weapons if the United States agreed to formally end the Korean War and promise not to invade his country. In a confidence-building gesture ahead of a proposed summit meeting with President Trump, a suddenly loquacious and conciliatory Mr. Kim also said he would invite experts and journalists from South Korea and the United States to watch the shutdown next month of his country’s only known underground nuclear test site. In Washington, Trump officials spoke cautiously about the chances of reaching a deal and laid out a plan for the dismantling of the North’s nuclear program, perhaps over a two-year period. That would be accompanied by a “full, complete, total disclosure of everything related to their nuclear program with a full international verification,” said John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser. The apparent concessions from the youthful leader were widely welcomed as promising signs of ending the standoff on the Korean Peninsula, frozen in place since fighting in the Korean War ended 65 years ago. But skeptics warned that North Korea previously made similar pledges of denuclearization on numerous occasions, with little or no intention of abiding by them. Mr. Kim’s friendly gestures, they said, could turn out to be nothing more than empty promises aimed at lifting sanctions on his isolated country. A South Korean government spokesman, Yoon Young-chan, provided remarkable details of a summit meeting the two Korean heads of state held on Friday, when Mr. Kim made history by becoming the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South. “I know the Americans are inherently disposed against us, but when they talk with us, they will see that I am not the kind of person who would shoot nuclear weapons to the south, over the Pacific or at the United States,” Mr. Kim told Mr. Moon, according to Mr. Yoon’s account. It was another in a series of startling statements by Mr. Kim, whose country threatened to do exactly those things during the height of nuclear tensions last year. Mr. Kim’s apparent willingness to negotiate away his nuclear arsenal was revealed just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke for the first time about a “good conversation” he had with Mr. Kim during his secret visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, over Easter weekend. Mr. Pompeo told ABC News in a broadcast on Sunday that the Trump administration’s objective was “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization” with North Korea, and that Mr. Kim was prepared to “lay out a map that would help us achieve” denuclearization. “We had an extensive conversation on the hardest issues that face our two countries,” Mr. Pompeo said. “I had a clear mission statement from President Trump. When I left, Kim Jong-un understood the mission exactly as I described it today.” But Mr. Bolton, a longtime critic of past diplomacy with North Korea, expressed skepticism on Sunday, recalling past moments that looked hopeful. Those would include a commitment by Pyongyang in the 1990s to give up its nuclear program and the destruction of a nuclear power cooling tower in 2008 as part of a similar promise. “We want to see real commitment,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “We don’t want to see propaganda from North Korea. We’ve seen words. We’ve seen words so far.” Asked about North Korea’s insistence on a promise by the United States not to invade, Mr. Bolton noted that was an old demand that had been rolled out on other occasions. “We’ve heard this before,” he said. “The North Korean propaganda playbook is an infinitely rich resource.” Mr. Trump sees the potential for a historic deal with Mr. Kim, “a breakthrough nobody would have imagined a few months ago,” Mr. Bolton told Fox News on Sunday, but his administration is not “starry eyed about what may happen here.” “I think it is going to happen; the dates and the places are still under discussion,” he said. “I think the president is eager to do it as soon as possible.” On Friday, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon signed a joint declaration recognizing “a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula” and “complete denuclearization” as a common goal of the two Koreas. But during the summit events, some of which were broadcast live around the world, Mr. Kim never publicly renounced his nuclear weapons. Even in the additional details released on Sunday by South Korean officials, Mr. Kim appeared to hedge his bets, indicating that denuclearizing his country could be a long process that required multiple rounds of negotiations and steps to build trust. But he laid out a vague idea of what his impoverished country would demand in return for giving up its nuclear weapons. “If we meet often and build trust with the United States, and if an end to the war and nonaggression are promised, why would we live in difficulty with nuclear weapons?” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying by South Korean officials. Mr. Moon briefed Mr. Trump on the meeting during a call on Saturday, telling him that Mr. Kim had said that he and Mr. Trump could “get along well,” to which Mr. Trump responded that he “looked forward” to their meeting. On Sunday, Mr. Moon also spoke with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to relay Mr. Kim’s willingness to open dialogue with Tokyo, which is threatened by the North’s nuclear weapons and missile development. The peacemaking comments stand in stark contrast to previous remarks and actions by Mr. Kim, who drove the Peninsula close to the brink of war last year by undertaking a series of missile and nuclear tests. He suddenly switched to diplomatic overtures this year, extending an offer to meet Mr. Trump, which, surprisingly, was accepted. A week ago, Mr. Kim announced an end to all nuclear and long-range missile tests and the closing of the nuclear test site in mountainous Punggye-ri, in northeast North Korea. In the meeting on Friday, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon also agreed to start talks this year with Washington to negotiate a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, one of the key security guarantees that the North has long demanded. But North Korea has so far offered no timeline for dismantling its nuclear weapons and facilities. Nor has it clarified how it defines a “nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,” and especially whether that means a withdrawal or significant reconfiguration of American troops based in South Korea, as it has demanded before. Even before Mr. Moon met with Mr. Kim, South Korean officials said any joint statement was bound to be vague on the terms of denuclearization because Mr. Kim would try to settle critical issues directly with Washington. If Mr. Kim intends to win a peace treaty, diplomatic recognition and billions of dollars in economic aid from Washington and its allies, as South Korean officials hope he does, trading away his nuclear arsenal is his biggest bargaining chip. He cannot reveal his hand too soon, South Korean officials said. Skeptics fear that Mr. Kim does not really intend to give up his nuclear weapons and is merely trying to soften his image, escape sanctions and make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to continue to threaten military action. But South Korean officials argue that Mr. Kim is sincere in trading his nuclear weapons for a promise to end hostilities and get Washington’s help to improve his country’s economy. North Korea’s promise to invite outsiders to Punggye-ri reflected “Mr. Kim’s determination to actively and pre-emptively deal with the process of verifying denuclearization,” Mr. Yoon said. In another conciliatory gesture toward South Korea, Mr. Kim made his own pledge of nonaggression toward the South. “I am determined not to repeat the painful history of the Korean War. As the same nation living on the same land, we should never shed blood again,” he told Mr. Moon, according to Mr. Yoon. Mr. Kim even vowed to readjust his country’s clock to match the time zone in South Korea, which with the rest of the region runs 30 minutes ahead of the North’s. “When I was sitting in the waiting room, I saw two clocks on the wall, one of the Seoul time and the other of the Pyongyang time, and I felt bad about it,” Mr. Kim was quoted as telling Mr. Moon. “Why don’t we reunify our clocks first?”","SEOUL, South Korea — Keeping diplomatic developments coming at a head-snapping pace, the South Korean government said on Sunday that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had told President Moon Jae-in that he would abandon his nuclear weapons if the United States agreed to formally end the Korean War and promise not to invade his country.

The announcement came after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson met for more than two hours with Mr. Moon in New York, where they discussed ways for Mr. Kim to give up nuclear arms without losing face or jeopardizing his regime. It was unclear whether Mr. Kim made any commitment to denuclearization in return. But the talks between the top American diplomat and Mr. Moon came as an apparent attempt to tamp down fears among some analysts here and abroad that the president might be rushing into negotiations too quickly with a man whose record includes assassinations, torture, public executions and other atrocities against the people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The talks also seemed aimed at reassuring Americans, many of whom are skeptical about a deal with Mr. Kim and have been urging Mr. Trump to hold out longer before agreeing to meet him. The White House has not yet announced when such a sit-down will take place, but it is expected to happen soon after the conclusion of this week’s Group of Seven economic leaders’ meetings. The announcement of a possible summit also comes amid rising tensions over the deployment by Mr. Kim of new intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching America and its allies in Asia. On Friday, North Korea fired four short-range projectiles off the east coast, which flew less than 300 miles, prompting condemnation and threats from both China and Russia. It was not clear what kind of response North Korea expected from those countries or how much influence either nation could exert to restrain it from further provocations. But the missile launches appeared intended as an early warning shot across Washington’s bow — the first salvo in what may prove a long war of words between the countries. And they underscored the risk of miscalculation or misunderstanding in dealing with a dictator like Mr. Kim, a master showman who appears to relish playing games and taunting adversaries and rivals alike. “The Trump administration is trying to get its ducks in order,” Robert Sutter, director of Asian studies at Georgetown University, wrote on Twitter. “It has no idea where the conversation with Kim is going.” A senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation described the latest development as an effort by Mr. Trump and the secretary of state to make sure that North Korea understands how serious Washington is about pursuing the path toward peace and reconciliation. It was not immediately clear why Mr. Kim had chosen now, when he faces mounting pressure at home from hardliners opposed to engagement and a growing threat from North Korea’s neighbors and regional powers to impose crippling sanctions and military action, to offer such concessions. “We are ready for dialogue anytime, anywhere without preconditions,” Mr. Kim reportedly said during the discussions in Pyongyang with Mr. Tillerson. Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump exchanged letters last year through intermediaries in Singapore. Since then, however, there have been few signs that their relationship was progressing beyond a series of tweets in the fall. After Mr. Tillerson’s visit to South Korea last weekend to discuss preparations for a potential meeting, it became increasingly likely that one was imminent. It was still unknown what form a summit could take, although Mr. Tillerson suggested it could include other nations besides just the two Koreas. South Korea, Japan, Australia and Canada are all members of the so-called Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. China, a member of that group as well, also expressed interest. A summit could come within weeks. On Saturday, South Korean news agencies reported that North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho met in Beijing with Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandan, a former ambassador to Washington and longtime confidant of China’s paramount leadership, the Communist Party chief Xi Jinping. Mr. Ri told reporters afterward that he and his counterpart had reached agreement on the agenda of the upcoming intergovernmental summits. He did not elaborate, but said he hoped that “the atmosphere surrounding” them would “be conducive to solving problems between us,” adding, “I am confident that we can resolve issues related to our relations in accordance with that spirit.” It was not clear when the two men might meet again., or if they would do so in advance of any planned Trump-Kim summit, although it seems unlikely. In addition to the talks with Mr. Kim, the president had another high-stakes encounter in Manhattan with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, his second since taking office, a session described by aides as cordial. The leaders agreed on the need for cooperation between their militaries against terrorism, including Islamic extremism. They were set to attend the opening ceremony of a World Cup soccer match later on Sunday in Moscow between England and Tunisia. But the talks between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump took a dramatic turn late on Saturday night after Mr. Putin and other senior officials met at an undisclosed location with Sergei N. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to Washington, who was fired last week amid allegations that he may have been involved in efforts by Russians to interfere in last year’s presidential election. A White House official said Saturday evening that the two men discussed “a range of issues,” but did not provide details. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump knew about the meeting before the news broke publicly early on Sunday morning. In response, a spokesman for Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of Mr. Trump’s harshest critics in Congress and a former prisoner of war during Vietnam, called on him to fire the national security adviser H. R. McMaster. “If true that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and others attended this secretive gathering, then National Security Advisor HR McMaster must resign immediately,” Mr. McCain wrote. Mr. McMaster has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks over reports of contacts with Michael T. Flynn, the retired general whom Mr. Trump abruptly dismissed last month as head of his transition team, which included discussions with the son and daughter-in-law of Mr. Putin about lifting sanctions imposed by Mr. Obama in retaliation for alleged interference in American elections. On Friday, after an article appeared about the contacts between General Flynn and the younger members of Mr. Putin’s inner circle, a top aide to the national security adviser issued a statement saying that no such meetings had taken place, although the administration had acknowledged some contact with Mr. Flynn about foreign policy matters, including Syria. On Sunday morning, the White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was unaware of the nature of the conversation. He also declined to say if he believed it was appropriate for Mr. Putin to meet with Donald J. McGahn II, the new counsel to the president, and Rob Porter, his staff director, without informing White House lawyers, even though the White House chief legal officer has access to all classified information. “I don’t know what happened there, I can tell you,” he said. “But we are going to get back to you.” Asked to elaborate on whether he thought that meeting had violated protocol or ethics rules, Mr. Spicer replied: “No, but I think we are getting into semantics here.” He added, “We will be able to answer those questions when the time comes. We will give you more detail than I am giving you now, because that is how these things work.” The episode came just days after it emerged that the F.B.I. interviewed several people connected to General Flynn’s conversations with Mr. Kislyak. Those interviews occurred last December, according to current and former law enforcement officials, as part of an inquiry into possible ties between associates of President Trump and Russian government operatives. The disclosure came from Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a Democrat who sits on the Intelligence Committee, during testimony before lawmakers investigating potential collusion between the Kremlin and the campaign. Mr. Schiff was asked why he felt compelled to reveal it now, given that he did not raise the issue until Sunday morning, after it became public through reporting by CNN. Mr. Schiff responded, “Because it’s important that you understand that these issues were raised and they were taken seriously, that it wasn’t something we could ignore.” Mr. Spicer’s comments echoed statements made earlier in the day by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who insisted that “there are plenty of examples where other presidents have done similar things” when discussing the contacts. She told Fox News Channel, “There’s nothing wrong with having communications between countries and governments.” Asked whether she considered that Mr. Kushner’s attendance was inappropriate, Ms. Sanders replied, “That wasn’t my understanding, but again I haven’t seen anything beyond reports on television.” She said the president’s sons — Eric, Ivanka and Don junior, all advisers on the transition team — were aware of Mr. Trump’s decision to invite them to a dinner meeting with the Russian delegation.",Falcon,True,incorrect punctuation is the hint
7,"WASHINGTON — As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments on Wednesday on whether to invalidate a crucial part of the president’s health care law, Obama administration officials say they are doing nothing to prepare for what could be a catastrophic defeat. Administration officials insist that any steps they could take to prepare for the potential crisis would be politically unworkable and ineffective, and that pursuing them would wrongly signal to the justices that reasonable solutions existed. The do-nothing strategy is meant to reinforce for the court what White House officials believe: that a loss in the health care case would be unavoidably disastrous for millions of people. There are no contingency plans in place if the court invalidates the Affordable Care Act subsidies that 7.5 million people in 34 states are receiving, administration officials said. No one is strategizing with governors or insurance company executives or lawmakers. There is no public relations plan to reassure people who might suddenly have to pay more for insurance. If the court rejects the subsidies — a decision unlikely to arrive until the end of the session in late June or early July — health experts said premiums could triple within weeks, causing millions of people to lose coverage. That could quickly lead to a collapse of the health insurance markets in two-thirds of the country. “If they rule against us, we’ll have to take a look at what our options are. But I’m not going to anticipate that,” President Obama said Monday in an interview with Reuters. “I’m not going to anticipate bad law.” The strategy echoes the administration’s refusal through most of 2012 to acknowledge any planning for the effect of across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration, insisting that the draconian cuts would never come to pass. (They did.) Also in 2012, the White House and its allies said there were no plans for the Supreme Court ruling on a challenge to the health law’s individual mandate. (The court upheld the mandate.) In the current health care case, legal experts said the White House was savvy in making clear that the situation was dire. They said the justices regularly considered the broader effect of their decisions and often took into account how the executive branch or Congress might respond to a ruling. Jeffrey L. Fisher, a law professor at Stanford University, said the justices are likely to talk about the administration’s lack of contingency plans when they meet behind closed doors on Friday for their first conference after hearing arguments. ”They are going to think about whether they buy it, whether they think it’s strategy,” Mr. Fisher said. “It’s something that a court would traditionally at least put into the melting pot of consideration.” The latest legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act was brought by opponents who say Congress authorized subsidies to be issued  only to people who signed up for coverage in one of 17 state-run marketplaces, not those who enrolled through the federal HealthCare.gov website. Government lawyers say lawmakers intended the subsidies to be available everywhere. Mr. Obama’s advisers continue to say they are confident the law will survive the court challenge. But if it does not, within weeks of the ruling the government will have to stop sending tax credits to insurance companies on behalf of the millions who signed up through HealthCare.gov and were promised hefty subsidies to offset the cost of premiums. Most of those people would no longer be required by the law’s individual mandate to have insurance, because part of the law provides exemptions when affordable insurance is not available. As a result, all but the sickest would choose to cancel their insurance, experts predicted. With healthy people no longer choosing to be covered, experts said, most insurance companies would pull out of the markets in those states rather than cover only the sickest — and most expensive — customers. The result would be a “death spiral,” according to the Supreme Court brief filed by America’s Health Insurance Plans, the nation’s health insurance trade group. “It would leave consumers in those states with a more unstable market and far higher costs,” the group argued in the brief. Soon after the ruling, health care experts said, the White House could work with lawmakers to pass new legislation clarifying that the subsidies should be available everywhere. But that would require the unlikely support of Republicans who have fiercely opposed the president’s law and sought to repeal it. “It would take a wrecking ball to a major part of the Affordable Care Act,” Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said of a loss in the court. “It’s hard to see how it would be fixed, absent legislation. And Republicans have made it clear they have no interest in fixing it.” Experts said the administration could encourage more states to set up their own insurance marketplaces, which are permitted to provide subsidies. Health experts said the administration could also provide waivers, financial assistance or technical expertise to help the states, although the process could take years to complete. States with a Republican governor or legislature are likely to refuse. The federal government could also approve the formation of regional insurance marketplaces, but political leaders in the states would have to agree to participate. “There aren’t any magic solutions here,” said Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. If the court throws out the subsidies, experts say, it is unclear whether Mr. Obama, the court or Republicans will be blamed for the confusion. “A court decision would unleash a giant game of political chicken,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that does research on health care. “How that ends up would depend a lot on who is getting the blame for the chaos that would ensue.” The situation has already enraged the administration’s Republican critics, who hope the court will do what they have been unable to accomplish in Congress: unravel the president’s chief domestic accomplishment. “By admitting they have no contingency plan to assist the millions that may lose subsidies, the administration confirms how the misguided law is unworkable for the American people,” Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said last week. Mr. Hatch is part of a Republican group that is working on proposals to help stabilize the insurance markets in the aftermath of a ruling against the government. He said the goal of the group’s efforts was to eventually repeal and replace the president’s health care law. “We would provide financial assistance to help Americans keep the coverage they picked for a transitional period,” Mr. Hatch and two other senators wrote in a letter in The Washington Post this week. In the House, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and several other lawmakers are proposing legislation to allow states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and to provide tax credits to buy health insurance that could help people who might lose their subsidies. The Republican lawmakers have not offered details of their proposals, but Mr. Obama’s allies said they expected the Republicans to do little to ease the crisis if people could no longer receive subsidies. “They should not be under any illusions that you can easily pick up the pieces,” Mr. Van Hollen said of the nine justices. He said the Supreme Court should keep that in mind as it heard the case. “If they render a decision that blows a hole in the law,” Mr. Van Hollen said, “there is no tidy fix to this.”","WASHINGTON — As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments on Wednesday on whether to invalidate a crucial part of the president’s health care law, Obama administration officials say they are doing nothing to prepare for what could be a catastrophic defeat.

Administration officials insist that any steps they could take to prepare for the potential crisis would be politically unworkable and ineffective, and that pursuing them would wrongly signal to the justices that reasonable solutions existed.. But in interviews with The New York Times, several former government officials said they were concerned about how President Trump might respond if he learned that his signature domestic achievement was being challenged by the court. “The fact is that we don’t have much time left at this point,” one senior official said. “If you think it can go down as quickly as it has gone up, I think people will panic.” A lawyer for Mr. Trump has called the legal challenge against the Affordable Care Act an attempt to undermine the constitutionality of the act, but the challengers themselves have not explained why their effort should succeed. And while some Democrats have argued that Republicans should work more closely with states before enacting major changes to health care legislation, there is little evidence that such collaboration would help. One Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said that the White House had been considering options to avoid a federal judge striking down parts of the law, including using executive orders or issuing guidance documents to state insurance regulators. Another official said that the Justice Department had considered how to deal with the possibility that the court would strike down the entire law. Still another official said the department was preparing contingency plans to protect people from losing coverage under the law. In addition, many of those planning to vote next week against the measure have expressed reservations about its benefits, which include lowering premiums for millions of low-income Americans, allowing young adults to stay on track into adulthood without having to pay out of pocket costs, and reducing deductibles. Some critics of the bill also worry that it does not do enough to address the needs of older Americans, whose medical bills often exceed the amount of money they receive through Medicare. “It’s going to be very hard to sell everyone on something that doesn’t have a lot of specifics,” said David Cutler, a law professor at Columbia University and a longtime opponent of Obamacare. “I’m worried about trying to convince people that it’s good because it’s better than what they’re getting now.” Mr. Trump has vowed to keep fighting until Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act, and he has repeatedly threatened to veto any congressional efforts to repeal the health law. He has made clear that he intends to use the threat of a lawsuit challenging the law to block Republican attempts to dismantle it. On Monday, the Senate voted 52 to 47 to approve a bipartisan measure that would allow states to opt out of certain aspects of the health law. That measure passed the House last month. If Mr. Trump loses, the consequences could be far graver: His presidency could collapse, leaving him unable to run again for office; the courts could rule that he cannot legally block new laws enacted by Congress; or even the country itself may face economic catastrophe. Mr. Trump has shown no inclination to make peace with the decision. In recent days, he has suggested that he would consider a pardon for himself, a suggestion that has raised fears among conservatives who believe that the president would never accept responsibility for his actions. Last weekend, he told Fox News viewers that he did not want to be pardoned. “I’ve got my own lawyers, and I’ll probably be talking to them,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m not looking forward to the other side coming after me for pardoning myself.” Mr. Trump also appeared to suggest on Twitter on Sunday night that he would like to see his tax records released so that he could claim that he paid all his taxes. At least three current and former members of the Trump campaign said the president did not intend to honor his pledge to release his returns. Mr. Trump has insisted publicly that he has never broken his promise to release his returns. Mr. Trump’s advisers have said privately that the president will eventually release his returns, though he has resisted calls for him to do so. After winning election, Mr. Trump promised to reveal his returns when he was asked. But he has resisted requests from reporters and others to disclose his returns. He has refused to answer questions about his finances from reporters who have written stories questioning his claims of income and expenses. And he has declined to answer questions from lawmakers who have pressed him over the issue. On Saturday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said that Mr. Trump would release his returns “in due course.” But the returns are likely to remain private indefinitely.. Mr. Trump has denied reports that he has received threats from Russian intelligence officers, saying that he has never met with anyone linked to Russia. He has also denied accusations of financial improprieties involving foreign governments. He has said that he is not required to report large amounts of income earned overseas. Mr. Trump’s business empire includes real estate deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars. As president, he owns stakes in two hotels and a golf course. His personal assets include the Miss Universe pageant, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and a condominium complex in New York City. The New Yorker magazine reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had been warned by federal investigators about possible conflicts of interest related to his business interests. In an interview broadcast on CNN last week, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, defended Mr. Trump against questions over whether he was being investigated for potential crimes. “I think it’s fair to say that we have no idea what the investigation is looking into at this point, but I would certainly be surprised if there were any criminal charges or anything like that,” Mr. Spicer said. On Thursday evening, the president said that he did not know why CNN had chosen to run the story, adding: “It’s probably because they want ratings. They don’t care who gets hurt.” But the president’s remarks seemed to suggest that the investigation may involve more than just one company. And Mr. Trump’s refusal to answer questions about his finances — which are routinely scrutinized by congressional committees — suggested that he might face additional scrutiny as well. A spokesman for Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the committee had been contacted by Mr. Trump’s lawyers about the matter. He declined to elaborate. Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said on Twitter that the president was “not under investigation” for any wrongdoing. Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week. The president’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is expected to testify publicly on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is scheduled to appear before the same committee on Monday. If Mr. Trump is questioned about his business dealings, he could invoke executive privilege, which allows him to refuse to answer questions. It is unclear how much information Mr. Trump will be able to withhold from Congress. The Justice Department has asked for documents from companies connected to Mr. Trump. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said on Friday that he wanted to hear directly from the president, rather than through a third party. “If you’re going to take shots at Donald J. Trump, you need to take them directly,” he said. “You can’t go around shooting people in other countries. You have to take them personally.” Mr. Trump’s comments came hours after several news organizations reported that the F.B.I. raided a Manhattan office of Fusion GPS, the research firm that compiled the so-called Steele dossier. The New York Times and BuzzFeed News reported that agents seized records relating to the dossier, including emails between journalists and Christopher Steele, a British citizen who claimed to be working for the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The Times and BuzzFeed News cited unnamed sources familiar with the case. At least three members of the bureau have since confirmed their involvement. Fusion GPS, founded by Glenn R. Simpson, a retired military intelligence officer, hired opposition researcher Peter Schweizer to conduct research on behalf of Democrats seeking to discredit Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Steele’s work was funded by the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the dossier a “witch hunt” and has repeatedly denied having anything to do with it. The president has questioned the value of the dossier, saying that he had read only snippets of its contents. When pressed on Friday, he refused to discuss specifics. “I am not going to talk about my tax returns,” he said. “That’s none of your business.” He added: “You can ask me all sorts of things. What does the State Department have to do with it? That’s none of your business.” Mr. Trump’s lawyers have argued that he cannot be compelled to answer questions about his business dealings without risking damaging his presidency. While the president has repeatedly insisted that he has nothing to hide, the president’s lawyers have said that the Constitution bars presidents from being forced to reveal their taxes.",GPT-NEO,True,punctuation
8,"WASHINGTON — In private, President Trump sometimes addresses his adult children as “baby,” a term of endearment tinged with a New Yorker’s wisecracking edge. And now that Mr. Trump’s babies have been swept into the vortex of his storm-tossed presidency, he is taking it personally. The fierce criticism of a meeting between Mr. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Kremlin-linked lawyer in June 2016 has left the president by turns angry, defensive and protective but ultimately relieved that for now, the worst appears to be over, people who spoke to him said Wednesday. For Mr. Trump, who has faced a barrage of questions about his own dealings with Russia, watching his closest family members come under harsh scrutiny for things they are accused of doing to help his presidential campaign has marked an uncomfortable turn in the foreign entanglement that has shadowed him since he took office in January. The latest disclosures also focused renewed attention on Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who attended Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting last June with the Russian, Natalia Veselnitskaya. And they came on the heels of a much-criticized decision by his daughter Ivanka to sit in her father’s vacated chair at a summit meeting in Germany. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump discarded pleas from advisers to avoid wading into the tempest over Donald Trump Jr., and posted a fusillade of tweets defending him. He denounced reports of the meeting — to collect incriminating information about Hillary Clinton — as part of “the greatest Witch Hunt in political history” and even embraced the theory that his son might have been “the victim” in the case. “He was great,” Mr. Trump told people about his son’s appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program the previous evening. By midday Wednesday, the mercurial president was telling friends and advisers that he believed the situation had improved. “I think this is getting better,” he said to one group of aides, hours before he was set to take off for a trip to France to mark Bastille Day. The Trump family, friends said, always draws closer under intense pressure. But Mr. Trump bridles at the idea that his children, who have not spent years in the public spotlight like him, are now facing unrelenting scrutiny over what he believes to be a manufactured scandal by the news media. While Donald Trump Jr. has been on the firing line, the meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya could arguably be a bigger distraction for Mr. Kushner. As a senior adviser to the president, he is involved in several of the administration’s most sensitive foreign-policy issues, from China to the Middle East peace process. His involvement in the meeting led reporters to ask the White House whether he still held his security clearance. Also under scrutiny is how forthcoming Mr. Kushner was with his father-in-law about the nature of the June meeting. He met with Mr. Trump to discuss the issue, according to advisers to the White House, around the time he updated his federal disclosure form to include Ms. Veselnitskaya’s name on a list of foreign contacts that Mr. Kushner was required to submit to the F.B.I. to obtain a security clearance. Mr. Kushner supplemented the list of foreign contacts three times, adding more than 100 names, people close to him said. Mr. Kushner played down the significance of the meeting and omitted significant details, according to two people who were briefed on the exchange. They said Mr. Kushner informed the president that he had met with a Russian foreign national, and that while he had to report the name, it would not cause a problem for the administration. Another official said Mr. Kushner’s assurance to the president was based on the fact that nothing came of the June meeting. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said he had not been told last summer that his son was meeting with a Russian lawyer. “No, that I didn’t know until a couple of days ago when I heard about this,” he said. Mr. Kushner, colleagues say, has kept up a regular work schedule, meeting on Wednesday with Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, to discuss the administration’s impending moves on trade. He is also in touch with Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, who is in Israel for meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. And next week, he plans to take part in a high-level economic dialogue with China. Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka, are not accompanying Mr. Trump to Paris. Instead they plan to attend the annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, sponsored by the investment firm Allen & Company. An official said the couple would pay for their own travel and lodgings. Mr. Kushner is expected to cooperate in the next several weeks with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees that are looking into Russia’s intervention in the American election and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign. He will have to devote some time to preparing for those appearances with his team of lawyers. Colleagues of Mr. Kushner said he had remained focused and upbeat despite the drumbeat of negative headlines — a trait they ascribe to his experience dealing with the legal troubles of his father, Charles Kushner, who was convicted of tax evasion and witness tampering. But even as the White House labors to present a business-as-usual facade, there is evidence that Mr. Trump’s family will be drawn deeper into the investigation. Two officials familiar with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation said the panel was now planning to expand its inquiry to include Donald Trump Jr. The officials said Mr. Trump’s shifting reasons for the meeting — and his acknowledgment that he was lured by the promise of Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton — had forced the Senate panel to begin examining his role in the campaign, and any contacts he may have had with Russians. The first step, officials said, would be for Senate investigators to sit down with Mr. Trump. The Senate panel might also request that he turn over emails and financial records from any dealings with Russia, which they have done with other subjects of their investigation. At the same time, Mr. Kushner now looms larger in the Senate investigation, the officials said. Its investigators concluded as early as March that his meetings during the transition with the Russian ambassador and a Russian banker tied to the Kremlin warranted further scrutiny. For the president, friends said, the pain of seeing his son ensnared in the Russia scandal was real. In part, that is because, of all his children, he has had the most complicated relationship with Donald Jr., who was a teenager when his parents divorced and did not speak to his father for a year. Friends who have known the Trump family for many years said they believed Donald Trump Jr., in setting up the meeting, was only focused on trying to help — and even impress — his father with information that could help his campaign. President Trump has been equally protective of his other children. After Ivanka came under criticism for taking her father’s seat in Germany, he defended her in a tweet and cited Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. “When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries,” he said, “I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!” Nobody offered a more passionate defense of Ivanka than Donald Trump Jr. “Look at the attacks on Ivanka,” he told Mr. Hannity on Tuesday night. “If she was anyone else’s daughter, she’d be a feminist icon — this incredible, brilliant, well-spoken woman. And they try to belittle her at every chance. It’s really sad.” “For me as a family member, as her brother, as her older brother, you know you do take it personally and it does make you want to fight back,” he added. “What we are is we are fighters and they don’t take well to that, either, because most people don’t like being called on their stuff.”","WASHINGTON — In private, President Trump sometimes addresses his adult children as “baby,” a term of endearment tinged with a New Yorker’s wisecracking edge.

And now that Mr. Trump’s babies have been swept into the vortex of his storm-tossed presidency, he is taking it personally. when they are criticized for their roles in running the family business and other ventures. The president has told confidants that he feels like an outcast among members of his own family because so many people are attacking them publicly. He believes that the criticism is unfair and unjustified, given how hard all three of his grown sons work to run the Trump Organization while also serving in various government posts. But even if Mr. Trump were not under siege from critics who say there should be no mixing of politics and profit, some ethics experts believe that having one’s relatives working at the same company creates conflicts of interest that cannot easily be resolved. For example: Should Donald Jr., Eric or Ivanka Trump recuse themselves from discussions about foreign policy matters involving countries where the Trump Organization does business? Or would such a move violate federal law by depriving the president of advice on issues affecting American companies overseas? Would any decision made without those advisers be considered influenced by improper motives? Those questions will become more acute after reports this weekend said Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior White House adviser, had met privately last December with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, along with Michael T. Flynn, then the national security adviser, and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. Mr. Kushner later omitted details of that meeting from disclosure forms required of him, according to documents released Friday night by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was considering terminating his eldest daughter’s job as assistant to the president and adviser. Ms. Trump, 35, whose husband, Jared Kushner, serves as a top White House adviser, helped her father win the election campaign before becoming a key player in the administration. Her role has drawn scrutiny since she did not list her position on financial disclosures filed earlier this year. She has defended herself against accusations that she may have broken conflict-of-interest laws by continuing to receive payments from the Trump Organization during her time in Washington. A spokeswoman declined to comment further on Sunday. It remains unclear whether Mr. Trump intends to take action against either of his daughters, but he appears to be most upset about the attacks on his youngest child, Barron. In recent days, Mr. Trump has lashed out repeatedly at critics who question why his wife, Melania, and two teenage sons remain living in Manhattan rather than moving to Washington. Some critics noted that the Trumps could rent space in the White House residence, which is larger and better appointed than the couple’s penthouse near Central Park. Others pointed out that Barron, 10, might find it difficult to adjust to life in Washington immediately following his mother’s transition from first lady to first citizen. Still others suggested that Mrs. Trump might want to stay close to her son until he finishes school next June. “It doesn’t look good,” Mr. Trump complained Saturday evening to friends outside Mar-a-Lago, referring to the criticism directed toward his wife and children. During a dinner party inside the club, Mr. Trump expressed frustration again about what he described as “the horrible things” being written about his family. One guest recalled hearing him complain bitterly about news articles saying that Barron needed to leave behind his friends and start new ones in Washington. Another person present remembered Mr. Trump grumbling about the suggestion that the boy remained in New York City only to help enrich the Trump Organization through its lease of a building housing the Trump International Hotel & Tower. “That’s ridiculous!” the president exclaimed. His anger continued into Sunday morning, when he posted another series of early-morning Twitter messages aimed at his detractors. “The fake news media wants me to apologize for something I didn’t do - my Sons, both daytime and nighttime, are extremely successful,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I am proud of them! Many people would like to see us ‘break up,’ & live apart.” Later, he added: “People love seeing @BarronTrump on @FoxNews. Also @EricTrump & @DonaldJTrumpJr doing great jobs as Execs of @realDonaldTrump org. Very little focus put on that?” In addition to the controversies surrounding his adult children, Mr. Trump faces questions about the potential conflicts posed by his ownership stake in the Trump Organization — estimated between $ 150 million and more than $3 billion — which is being run day-to-day by Donald J. Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump, who are also executive vice presidents at the company. The president has said he will leave control of the organization to them after taking office but has not specified how or when. “The President-elect’s sons have been running the business for years,” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, told CNN last weekend. “They know what they signed up for.” But Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he may be forced to divest from some assets if there were concerns over possible conflicts of interest. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted: “I am greatly looking forward to showing my administration working with you and your group to make America Great Again!” He added later, “We need a good relationship w/ Russia - especially now! As to Russia, we should all be able to get along well together!” It was unclear whether either message referred specifically to the Russian government, though both men had previously expressed hopefulness about improving relations with Moscow. After meeting briefly during an international summit meeting this month in Peru, Secretary Tillerson met again with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia in Geneva on Wednesday afternoon before flying back home. The two men discussed Syria, Ukraine and other issues, according to State Department officials. A senior American official said it appeared likely that Mr. Tillerson would visit Russia soon; the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on any plans. While the Kremlin welcomed news of Mr. Tillerson’s appointment, its foreign minister, Sergei Y. Lavrov, warned against expecting too much change under him. “It remains our position that the U.S.-Russia relationship needs to improve,” Mr. Lavrov said Thursday morning at a joint news conference with his French counterpart, Jean-Marc Ayrault, in Paris. “But one cannot expect miracles because of personnel changes.” Still, Mr. Lavrov said he hoped Mr. Tillerson could help resolve tensions over Syria. “This is something that is very important for us,” he said. The United States and Russia support opposing sides in Syria’s civil war, and their conflicting interests there have led to sharp disagreements among Western powers and prompted the Obama administration to impose sanctions on Russia over its actions in Crimea. Asked why he believed Mr. Tillerson might be better placed to work out differences with Moscow than his predecessor, John Kerry, Mr. Lavrov replied, “Because he is new.” The secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, urged Mr. Tillerson to push ahead with efforts to end the conflict in Syria, where Russian forces have helped prop up President Bashar al-Assad. “In order to achieve peace, stability and security in Syria, we must stop the fighting, reduce violence, allow humanitarian access, start political talks and fight terrorism,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “And we call upon everyone involved to respect the cease-fire agreement.” The British prime minister, Theresa May, congratulated Mr. Tillerson on his confirmation and called him “an experienced leader” whose skills would serve Washington well. She said she looked forward to continuing cooperation with the United States on a range of global challenges including climate change, trade and migration. Ms. May spoke with Mr. Tillerson by phone shortly after he was confirmed by the Senate. Her office said she raised her concern about Russia’s role in eastern Ukraine, particularly around Crimea, and emphasized Britain’s commitment to maintaining economic pressure on Moscow until it complied fully with the Minsk agreements on ending hostilities in Donbass. Mr. Tillerson’s confirmation came amid growing uneasiness within Congress over his nomination. Democrats objected to his past statements calling for closer ties with Russia and criticizing the Obama administration’s policies toward Moscow. Republicans praised Mr. Tillerson’s experience in the oil industry and his longstanding friendship with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.",LLaMa2,True,small letter in beginning of sentence.
9,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday backed off his threat to send the suspect in this week’s New York terrorist attack to the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but once again called for the man to be executed, a public intervention that could come back to haunt prosecutors in any future trial. In response to questions from reporters, Mr. Trump on Wednesday had said he would be open to transferring Sayfullo Saipov, the immigrant from Uzbekistan charged with plowing a pickup truck into passers-by in Manhattan and killing eight people, from the civilian justice system to the military system at Guantánamo. But after his offhand remark, aides sought to walk back the idea, saying it was merely notional. And the president was evidently briefed or saw something on television afterward about how the civilian courts have been more effective at convicting terrorism suspects than the troubled military tribunal system installed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The argument that Mr. Saipov should be tried in the same place where the terrorist attack that killed eight was committed mirrored the contention that President Barack Obama’s administration made when it sought to put Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, on trial in a civilian court in New York. But an uproar among city officials and business leaders at the time forced Mr. Obama’s Justice Department to abandon the plan and keep Mr. Mohammed at Guantánamo. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, chastised Mr. Trump for not declaring Mr. Saipov an enemy combatant so he might be interrogated for useful intelligence without worrying about any defendant rights embedded in the civilian judicial system. “I appreciate President Trump taking the gloves off when it comes to unleashing our military on ISIL,” Mr. Graham said, referring to the battlefield gains against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “However, I’m dumbfounded as to why the Trump administration still follows the Obama playbook when it comes to dealing with terror suspects.” That drew a retort from Vice President Mike Pence. “I got to tell you, there’s nothing about President Trump’s policies that mirror the last administration,” he told Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio. Skeptics of the military system were relieved by Mr. Trump’s turnabout. “It’s good that President Trump has realized that a prosecution of Saipov in federal court would be much faster and less legally complicated than sending him to Guantánamo for possible trial before military commission,” said John B. Bellinger III, a top White House and State Department lawyer under President George W. Bush. While Mr. Trump opted for a civilian handling of Mr. Saipov, the president’s call for capital punishment introduced a surprise complication that may burden prosecutors and help defense lawyers. Mr. Trump first broached the subject in a Twitter message posted shortly before midnight on Wednesday evening. Presidents are typically advised never to weigh in publicly on pending criminal cases. Such comments can be used by defense lawyers to argue that their clients cannot get a fair trial — especially when the head of the executive branch that will prosecute a case advocates the ultimate punishment before a judge has heard a shred of evidence at trial. But Mr. Trump is not one for cautious detachment, and he has disregarded such advice before. Just this week, a military judge said he would consider similar comments by Mr. Trump as evidence in favor of a lighter sentence for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to desertion and endangering fellow troops by walking away from his post in Afghanistan, where he was later captured and held prisoner by the Taliban for five years. Lisa Monaco, who ran the Justice Department’s national security division under Mr. Obama, said presidential comments “violate the golden rule” of independent law enforcement, could taint jury pools and call into question the rigorous process used to decide whether to seek the death penalty. “It doesn’t help the prosecutors,” she said. “It undermines the ability of the career prosecutors to do their job.” Other presidents have been criticized for offering public verdicts about pending criminal cases. In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon declared that Charles Manson “was guilty, directly or indirectly, of eight murders without reason” in the middle of his trial in the killings of the actress Sharon Tate and others. By the end of the day, the Manson team’s lawyers had moved for a mistrial, citing the president’s remarks, and Nixon issued what his press secretary called a “clarification” taking them back. “The last thing I would do is prejudice the legal rights of any person, in any circumstances,” Nixon said. The defendant later held up in court a newspaper with the headline “Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares.” But the judge allowed the trial to proceed, ultimately ending with a conviction. In 2005, Mr. Bush expressed confidence that Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the former Republican majority leader, would be acquitted, weeks before his trial on money laundering charges was to open. “I hope that he will, because I like him, and plus, when he’s over there, we get our votes through the House,” Mr. Bush told a television interviewer. His successor, Mr. Obama, forecast an execution for Mr. Mohammed, the Sept. 11 detainee. Defending the later-aborted decision to try Mr. Mohammed in civilian court rather than a military tribunal, Mr. Obama said critics would not find it “offensive at all when he’s convicted and when the death penalty is applied to him.” The impact of such comments is more pronounced in military justice cases since the president is the commander in chief of the judges and juries that determine guilt or innocence and hand down sentences. Responding to a wave of sexual harassment allegations in the military, Mr. Obama declared in 2013 that troops who commit sexual assault should be “prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged.” In this instance, he was not commenting on a particular defendant, but lawyers nonetheless argued that it constituted “unlawful command influence.” Such influence refers to actions by commanders that could be seen as an attempt to sway a court-martial. Defense lawyers in multiple cases cited Mr. Obama’s words. In one case in South Carolina, a judge noted the command influence issue in dismissing sexual assault charges against an Army officer. In another in Hawaii, a Navy judge decided that two defendants could not be punitively discharged because of the president’s comments. Mr. Trump has more than once offered strong words about people suspected of major crimes. He called the man who opened fire on a concert in Las Vegas last month a “very sick man” and “a very demented person,” but since the man killed himself, there will be no trial to influence. On Wednesday, he called Mr. Saipov “this animal.” As a candidate, Mr. Trump was unflinchingly vocal about Sergeant Bergdahl, calling him a “dirty rotten traitor” who should be executed. A military judge in February called the comments “disturbing and disappointing,” but decided that since they were made when Mr. Trump was a private citizen, not the president, they did not constitute undue command influence. Mr. Trump was more restrained when asked about Sergeant Bergdahl’s case last month, but not so much that it did not come up in court. “I can’t comment on Bowe Bergdahl,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden. “But I think people have heard my comments in the past.” After concerns were raised about the “but” in his comment, the White House sought to mitigate any possible damage with a statement. “The president expects all military personnel who are involved in any way in the military justice process to exercise their independent professional judgment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations,” the statement said. Col. Jeffery R. Nance, the Army judge presiding over the case, rejected a request to dismiss the case or limit the potential sentence because of Mr. Trump’s remarks, saying he had not been influenced. But he indicated that he would weigh the president’s comments before determining punishment. “I will consider the president’s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,” he said. Mr. Bellinger, the former Bush White House lawyer, noted that the Bergdahl case had already resulted in one White House statement walking back the president’s words. “The White House,” he said, “may now need to issue a similar statement with respect to a federal prosecution of Saipov.”","WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday backed off his threat to send the suspect in this week’s New York terrorist attack to the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but once again called for the man to be executed, a public intervention that could come back to haunt prosecutors in any future trial.

Bay, where detainees are held without access to lawyers or trials by jury. But after meeting privately for more than an hour Thursday morning with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has long advocated sending terrorism suspects there, and White House aides including Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, who have also pushed to use it as an alternative to criminal courts, Mr. Trump reversed course, saying in a statement: “We will seek out additional resources necessary through our government agencies to prevent these horrible acts of violence.” The president did not say what those additional resources might be. He added: “I am asking Congress to develop legislation allowing us to bring really bad dudes home fast!” Mr. Trump also tweeted about the case Thursday afternoon. The president, who is known to watch cable news shows like Fox News Channel and MSNBC, was clearly influenced by their coverage, which included calls by some commentators for Guantánamo as well as criticism of his decision. “The only reason I didn’t do it is because we need strong border security,” Mr. Trump told the network’s Sean Hannity in an interview broadcast Thursday night. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, explained the reversal by citing concerns among senior administration officials about how a transfer of custody from federal court to Guantánamo would play politically. She also noted that the Justice Department was still considering whether to pursue the death penalty against the defendant. The Justice Department declined to comment. In his tweet, Mr. Trump seemed to embrace the idea of executing terrorists in general and not just those captured overseas. “If they kill innocent Americans,” he wrote, “they should DIE! No games.” Mr. Sessions said Thursday night on CNN that he supported using Guantánamo, but only if Congress authorized its reopening and provided money and other support for prosecuting cases there. Mr. Sessions added that it would take time and effort to set up such a facility and said it might take years before a detainee convicted in civilian court and sentenced to life imprisonment there would actually arrive there. Mr. Saipov has been indicted in Federal District Court for murder and weapons charges stemming from Tuesday’s rampage and faces possible execution. His lawyer has asked to move the proceedings from Brooklyn and said he planned to plead insanity. Prosecutors said he appeared calm and lucid during questioning, which took place on Thursday, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter but spoke anonymously because they were not allowed to discuss details publicly. One official described him as appearing to understand what was happening around him, though another cautioned that Mr. Saipov, a naturalized United States citizen born to Muslim parents, may not fully grasp why he has become so controversial so quickly. In addition to Mr. Saipov, three others died, along with four police officers responding to reports of shots fired near Times Square. A total of 11 victims were wounded in all, five critically. Mr. Sessions also met on Thursday morning with Representative Peter King of Long Island and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, both Republicans, as part of a bipartisan push for tougher gun control measures, and then traveled to Capitol Hill to meet privately with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Both Republican leaders expressed concern about how the suspect obtained guns used in the shooting, but neither indicated any willingness to change existing laws. In remarks afterward, Mr. Trump appeared to acknowledge the difficulty of passing new restrictions in light of opposition to them by many conservatives. But the president said he believed in doing something. “You know, you can talk forever. You can go on talking and on debating,” he said. “But eventually you have to make decisions, right? And we have to get tough, folks, because otherwise there’s no way.” Mr. Trump, whose own rhetoric often includes inflammatory language against immigrants and Muslims, said he had been surprised that Democrats like Mrs. Clinton and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom she defeated last year, were reluctant to condemn her rival. “Hillary said nothing and Joe Biden didn’t even want to mention Hillary’s name,” Mr. Trump said. “They don’t know what to think, but I’ll tell you one thing: They better start thinking very rapidly as far as being soft-pedaled goes. Because this country doesn’t feel safe anymore. We don’t have borders. Our military isn’t ready.” — By Michael Sallah, Maggie Haberman, Nicholas Fandos, David Ewing Duncan, Jim Dwyer, William Kole and Ashley Southall.

The company's stock price was trading at about $9 per share on Friday morning, down from its high of more than $55 in late 2007. It closed on Thursday at $8.80. The company is owned by shareholders who are not affiliated with The New York Times or any other news organization. The New York Times Company owns about half the shares outstanding and controls most of its voting power. Its largest shareholder, as well as its biggest individual investor, is Michael Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg bought about 10 percent of the Times' stock, according to regulatory filings, for $5 million, making him one of its top investors. He holds $50 million worth of company stock today, and he has pledged to give it all away when he dies, to be split among his children. The company owns 100 percent of the voting rights. The Times Company has no debt or preferred stock outstanding. The Times' stock trades on a secondary market called Nasdaq Global Select Market, where companies can raise capital through initial public offerings. The Times went public in 1980, but Mr. Bloomberg did not buy into the offering until 1994, after it had already gone up significantly in value. In that period, the company raised more than $400 million by selling new shares. Mr. Bloomberg has said that he has never sold any of his holdings, even though they have appreciated greatly over time. His stake now has an estimated market value of $500 million. Mr. Bloomberg said that if he were ever forced to sell some or all of his stock holdings, it would only happen because the Times Company needed the money. But if he chose to do so voluntarily, it would probably not happen until the end of his life. That means, according to Mr. Bloomberg, that if he decided to retire or die in the next few years, the sale could take place in the middle of the year. If he did decide to sell some of his stake in the coming months, Mr. Bloomberg said, it could happen only if the company’s board approved such a move, as he does not want to make decisions without consulting them first. “I don’t think I will,” Mr. Bloomberg said of selling any shares, adding that he does not plan on retiring anytime soon. In addition to owning the company’s shares outright, he also holds options for another 1.3 million. Those shares represent 2 percent of his total stake, according to filings. In 2011, when the company reported earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, he told reporters he planned to hold onto the company’s shares for many years.",Falcon,True,
10,"MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted by advanced spyware sold to the Mexican government on the condition that it be used only to investigate criminals and terrorists. The targets include lawyers looking into the mass disappearance of 43 students, a highly respected academic who helped write anti-corruption legislation, two of Mexico’s most influential journalists and an American representing victims of sexual abuse by the police. The spying even swept up family members, including a teenage boy. Since 2011, at least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased about $80 million worth of spyware created by an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer. The software, known as Pegasus, infiltrates smartphones to monitor every detail of a person’s cellular life — calls, texts, email, contacts and calendars. It can even use the microphone and camera on phones for surveillance, turning a target’s smartphone into a personal bug. The company that makes the software, the NSO Group, says it sells the tool exclusively to governments, with an explicit agreement that it be used only to battle terrorists or the drug cartels and criminal groups that have long kidnapped and killed Mexicans. But according to dozens of messages examined by The New York Times and independent forensic analysts, the software has been used against some of the government’s most outspoken critics and their families, in what many view as an unprecedented effort to thwart the fight against the corruption infecting every limb of Mexican society. “We are the new enemies of the state,” said Juan E. Pardinas, the general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, who has pushed anti-corruption legislation. His iPhone, along with his wife’s, was targeted by the software, according to an independent analysis. “Ours is a society where democracy has been eroded,” he said. The deployment of sophisticated cyberweaponry against citizens is a snapshot of the struggle for Mexico itself, raising profound legal and ethical questions for a government already facing severe criticism for its human rights record. Under Mexican law, only a federal judge can authorize the surveillance of private communications, and only when officials can demonstrate a sound basis for the request. It is highly unlikely that the government received judicial approval to hack the phones, according to several former Mexican intelligence officials. Instead, they said, illegal surveillance is standard practice. “Mexican security agencies wouldn’t ask for a court order, because they know they wouldn’t get one,” said Eduardo Guerrero, a former analyst at the Center for Investigation and National Security, Mexico’s intelligence agency and one of the government agencies that use the Pegasus spyware. “I mean, how could a judge authorize surveillance of someone dedicated to the protection of human rights?” “There, of course, is no basis for that intervention, but that is besides the point,” he added. “No one in Mexico ever asks for permission to do so.” The hacking attempts were highly personalized, striking critics with messages designed to inspire fear — and get them to click on a link that would provide unfettered access to their cellphones. Carmen Aristegui, one of Mexico’s most famous journalists, was targeted by a spyware operator posing as the United States Embassy in Mexico, instructing her to click on a link to resolve an issue with her visa. The wife of Mr. Pardinas, the anti-corruption activist, was targeted with a message claiming to offer proof that he was having an extramarital affair. For others, imminent danger was the entry point, like a message warning that a truck filled with armed men was parked outside Mr. Pardinas’s home. “I think that any company that sells a product like this to a government would be horrified by the targets, of course, which don’t seem to fall into the traditional role of criminality,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, which examined the hacking attempts. The Mexican government acknowledges gathering intelligence against legitimate suspects in accordance with the law. “As in any democratic government, to combat crime and threats against national security the Mexican government carries out intelligence operations,” it said in a statement. But the government “categorically denies that any of its members engages in surveillance or communications operations against defenders of human rights, journalists, anti-corruption activists or any other person without prior judicial authorization.” The Mexican government’s deployment of spyware has come under suspicion before, including hacking attempts on political opponents and activists fighting corporate interests in Mexico. Still, there is no ironclad proof that the Mexican government is responsible. The Pegasus software does not leave behind the hacker’s individual fingerprints. Even the software maker, the NSO Group, says it cannot determine who, exactly, is behind specific hacking attempts. But cyberexperts can verify when the software has been used on a target’s phone, leaving them with few doubts that the Mexican government, or some rogue actor within it, was involved. “This is pretty much as good as it gets,” said Bill Marczak, another senior researcher at Citizen Lab, who confirmed the presence of NSO code on several phones belonging to Mexican journalists and activists. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that cybercriminals somehow got their hands on the software, the NSO Group says, because the technology can be used only by the government agency where it is installed. The company is part of a growing number of digital spying businesses that operate in a loosely regulated space. The market has picked up in recent years, particularly as companies like Apple and Facebook start encrypting their customers’ communications, making it harder for government agencies to conduct surveillance. Increasingly, governments have found that the only way to monitor mobile phones is by using private businesses like the NSO Group that exploit little-known vulnerabilities in smartphone software. The company has, at times, operated its businesses under different names. One of them, OSY Technologies, paid Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, more than $40,000 to be an advisory board member from May 2016 until January, according to his public financial disclosures. Before selling to governments, the NSO Group says, it vets their human rights records. But once the company licenses the software and installs its hardware inside intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the company says, it has no way of knowing how its spy tools are used — or whom they are used against. The company simply bills governments based on the total number of surveillance targets. To spy on 10 iPhone users, for example, the company charges $650,000 on top of a flat $500,000 installation fee, according to NSO marketing proposals reviewed by The New York Times. Even when the NSO Group learns that its software has been abused, there is only so much it can do, the company says, arguing that it cannot simply march into intelligence agencies, remove its hardware and take back its spyware. “When you’re selling AK-47s, you can’t control how they’ll be used once they leave the loading docks,” said Kevin Mahaffey, chief technology officer at Lookout, a mobile security company. Rather, the NSO Group relies on its customers to cooperate in a review, then turns over the findings to the appropriate governmental authority — in effect, leaving governments to police themselves. Typically, the company’s only recourse is to slowly cut off a government’s access to the spy tools over the course of months, or even years, by ceasing to provide new software patches, features and updates. But in the case of Mexico, the NSO Group has not condemned or even acknowledged any abuse, despite repeated evidence that its spy tools have been deployed against ordinary citizens and their families. Journalists, human rights defenders and anti-corruption campaigners have long faced enormous risks in Mexico. For decades, they have been followed, harassed, threatened and even killed for their work, occupational hazards more common in authoritarian states than in countries in good standing with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as Mexico is. But when President Enrique Peña Nieto came into office in 2012, promising to lift Mexico to its rightful place on the world stage, there was an inkling of hope that the nation’s democracy was coming into its own. His party passed a list of badly needed changes, taking aim at the failing education system and moving to enhance the transparency of Mexico’s bureaucracy. Competition in some core industries, like telecommunications, has increased. But by 2014, much of the early promise of the Peña Nieto administration was dashed by the crises subsuming it, including the mysterious disappearance of 43 teaching students after a clash with the police, and accusations that the president and his wife got a special deal on a multimillion-dollar home from a government contractor. The scandals have left an enduring mark on the president’s reputation. After a stunning rise built on a perfectly crafted image — a young, energetic president working across party lines, the embodiment of a new Mexico — Mr. Peña Nieto was suddenly recast as an out-of-touch, corrupt politician with abysmal approval ratings. In no small part, that fall was thanks to the Mexican journalists who broke news of the scandals, as well as the lawyers and activists who refused to let the country forget about them. “You have to remember this was a government that went from setting the agenda to being entirely reactive,” said Carlos Loret de Mola, a news anchor for Televisa who has some of the best sources inside the Mexican government. Mr. Loret de Mola, who received at least eight messages laced with NSO software, added, “They looked at journalists and thought, ‘They are bringing these things out and embarrassing us, so it’s better if we spy on them.’” Mexico is still a far cry from Turkey, which jails more journalists than any other nation in the world. It is hardly China, an authoritarian state where critics are silenced and a Western-style free press has been cast as a political peril by the government. But Mexico is in crisis on these fronts all the same. More journalists were killed in Mexico last year than during any other year this century, and 2017 is off to an even worse start. Government critics are routinely harassed and threatened, and now they are being targeted with incredibly sophisticated software. “The fact that the government is using high-tech surveillance against human rights defenders and journalists exposing corruption, instead of those responsible for those abuses, says a lot about who the government works for,” said Luis Fernando García, the executive director of R3D, a digital rights group in Mexico that has helped identify multiple abuses of Pegasus in Mexico. “It’s definitely not for the people.” Perhaps no journalist in Mexico has done as much to damage the reputation of the president than Carmen Aristegui. And few have paid as dearly for it. In 2014, she and her team broke the scandal of the so-called Casa Blanca, or White House, a story of real estate intrigue that involved a special deal handed to Mexico’s first lady, Angélica Rivera, by a major government contractor close to the president. The story reached a worldwide audience and forced the president’s wife to surrender the house, presenting the Mexican government with the sort of ethical quandary that in a different country might result in a congressional inquiry or the appointment of an independent prosecutor. Instead, the president was cleared of wrongdoing by a prosecutor who had worked closely with his campaign team, while Ms. Aristegui lost her job. That moment marked the beginning of a sustained campaign of harassment and defamation against her: lawsuits, break-ins at her offices, threats to her safety and the monitoring of her movements. “It’s been about getting revenge for the piece,” she said. “There’s really no other way to see it.” So when she began receiving text messages in 2015 from unknown numbers, instructing her to click on a link, she was suspicious. One message asked for her help in locating a missing child. Another alerted her to sudden charge on her credit card. And she received a text message purportedly from the American Embassy about a problem with her visa. Impersonating an American government official is a possible violation of United States law. When the messages failed to entice her to click on the links and inadvertently download the software, they grew increasingly strident, including one warning that she could be imprisoned. Several came from the same phone number, leaving a record of the spyware operator’s sloppiness. Still, the spyware operators pressed on. Starting as early as March, they began targeting Ms. Aristegui’s then-16-year-old son, Emilio, who was living in the United States at the time. Some of the texts were similar to the ones she had received. Others were made-up headlines about Ms. Aristegui, sent from what appeared to be a news agency. “The only reason they could be going after my son is in the hopes of finding something against me, to damage me,” she said. Ms. Aristegui is the embodiment of the hope — and the crushing limitations — for a free media in Mexico. Though she was fired over what her employer called internal disagreements, she continued publishing on her own, eventually drawing enough of an audience to sustain a team of reporters. But the work has taken its toll. In one lawsuit, filed by the president of her former employer, a judge cited Ms. Aristegui last November for her “excessive use of freedom of speech.” Her website, Aristegui Noticias, has been hacked numerous times, including on the eve of publishing a major investigation into the massacre of more than a dozen civilians by the federal police. And her offices were broken into last November. So brazen were the assailants that they didn’t bother wearing masks. Nor did they steal much — one computer, a watch and a bag hanging from the back of a chair. Their faces and fingerprints were captured on cameras in the office. Still, no one has been caught. The threats, harassment, even the spying, all of it she channels into work. “For me, I have opted to believe that my public work is what will best protect me,” she said. “The great challenge for journalists and citizens is that the fear serve us, and not conquer us.” It was Dec. 21, 2015, and Mr. Pardinas was at the beach with his family, trying to enjoy the start of his Christmas vacation. But his phone kept buzzing, at first with calls from lawyers, and then with an odd text message. It had been a long few months in an even longer campaign: to pass an unprecedented law forcing Mexico’s public servants to disclose their financial conflicts of interest. In November, he had presented a study on the costs of corruption in Mexico, confirming with facts and figures something that nearly all Mexicans knew in their hearts — that corruption was crippling the country. He followed it up with media interviews, poking fun at the Mexican government’s embarrassing response to corruption. He joked that it probably spent more money on coffee and cookies than on the office in charge of prosecuting graft. The study, the interviews, a seemingly endless gantlet of meetings with politicians — it all laid the groundwork for the new law, which Mr. Pardinas, a private citizen directing a public policy group, was helping to write. So even as Christmas approached and his family relaxed in the coastal town of Puerto Vallarta, Mr. Pardinas was busily consulting lawyers on the final draft, which he had just over a month to submit. And then a message: “My father died at dawn, we are devastated, I’m sending you the details of the wake, I hope you can come.” Attached was a link. Mr. Pardinas thought it odd that whoever had sent such a personal text was not even among the contacts in his phone. He showed his wife the message, and decided to ignore it. Things only picked up from there, both on his proposed law and the odd messages. The government roundly ignored his bill, until he and others gathered more than 630,000 signatures supporting it. Mr. Pardinas’s tone grew bolder. He told one radio host that “for the government of Mexico, anti-corruption measures are like garlic to a vampire.” Then came another text message. This one appeared to be from the news outlet Uno TV, which sends daily news headlines to cellphone users across the country. The headline struck him: “The History of Corruption Within the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.” It was particularly alarming because that was his organization. He declined once more to click on the link, suspecting foul play. More text messages came, including the next day. Only this time, having failed with Mr. Pardinas, they tried his wife. The message, sent from the same news headline service, said that leaked videos showed Mr. Pardinas having sexual relations with a member of his staff. It was also sent to a colleague. Mr. Pardinas called his wife, telling her that she appeared to be part of a broader harassment effort. “Oh, it’s these people again,” she responded. The campaign to pass the law continued, and the bill made it through Congress relatively unscathed. But the Senate decided to add an extra provision: Everyone who worked for a company that received government money would also have to disclose their interests and assets. That meant the bill would cover more than 30 million people. The president vetoed the bill, saying it needed more discussion, essentially kicking the can down the road. Mr. Pardinas continued his broadsides in interviews, naming obstructive lawmakers and well-connected companies that benefited from government money. Few activists go so far as to name names in interviews, but Mr. Pardinas, who holds a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics, plowed ahead anyway. The initiative seemed doomed. Yet another message arrived, on Aug. 1, this one laced with menace: “Listen, outside of your house is a truck with two armed guys, I took their photo look at them and be careful.” Mr. Pardinas, who was at work when this message came, once again declined to take the bait. But he did call his wife, again, asking her to look out their window to see if there was a truck parked outside. There was not. “By the end, my wife had Olympic-style training in this hacking stuff,” Mr. Pardinas said. Mario E. Patrón was on edge. The conference table was packed with fellow human rights defenders, including the United Nations commissioner for human rights in Mexico. Everyone was there to discuss the bombshell expected to drop. An international panel brought to Mexico to investigate the haunting disappearance of 43 teaching students was releasing its final report the next day, at the end of April 2016. The findings, Mr. Patrón knew, were going to be brutal. The government would be accused of negligence, incompetence, even malfeasance in its handling of the case. Like others in the room, Mr. Patrón, whose organization represents the parents of the missing students, was wondering how the government would respond. His phone buzzed and he glanced at the screen. “THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO GETS OUT IN FRONT OF THE GIEI,” the text message read, using the acronym for the international panel. It seemed like the news he had been waiting for. He showed the message to his colleague, then clicked on the link. But instead of an article or a news release, it simply redirected him to a blank page. Confused, he left the meeting and raced to his office to begin making calls to see what the government had in store. And like that, he fell into their trap. Mr. Patrón is the executive director of the  Miguel Augustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, perhaps the most highly respected human rights group in Mexico. The group focuses on the nation’s most serious cases of human rights abuses, making it a nettlesome critic of the government. In addition to Mr. Patrón, two other lawyers for the group were targeted with the software: Santiago Aguirre, the primary lawyer representing the families of the missing students, and Stephanie E. Brewer, a Harvard-educated American lawyer who has worked for the group since 2007. “We have always suspected they spied on us and listened to us,” Mr. Patrón said. “But to have evidence that we are victims of actual surveillance — it confirms that we are under threat. And that the government is willing to use illegal measures to try and stop us.” Beyond the missing students, Centro Prodh, as the group is called, is representing one of the few survivors of a military raid in 2014 in the town of Tlatlaya, where the army stormed a suspected cartel hide-out and killed 22 people. While pursuing the case, the group unearthed a memorandum ordering the soldiers to kill suspected cartel members, strengthening the argument that the events did not unfold as a firefight, as the military claimed, but were instead extrajudicial executions carried out by the soldiers. The organization’s clients also include the women of Atenco, a group of 11 university students, activists and market vendors who were arrested by the police more than 10 years ago during protests in the town of San Salvador Atenco and brutally sexually assaulted on the way to prison. Aside from the grave abuse of power, the case was especially sensitive: The governor who ordered the crackdown on the protesters was Enrique Peña Nieto, now the president of Mexico. From the very beginning, the case was an uphill battle. Arrested on trumped-up charges, some of the women spent more time in prison than the officers who raped them. Finding no recourse in Mexico, Ms. Brewer and others appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a regional body outside the Mexican judicial system, to review the case. And they waited — for nearly seven years. Finally, in 2015, the commission found in favor of the women, ordering the government to investigate the case all the way up the chain of command, a directive that would include Mr. Peña Nieto. Ultimately, the case was sent to the Inter-American Court, an independent judiciary with jurisdiction over Mexico, a major blow to the nation’s presidency. One evening Ms. Brewer was at home, getting ready for bed when a text message arrived. The date practically coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the assaults on the women, an eerie bookend to their decade-long struggle for justice. On her phone was a provocative question, a taunt even, asking whether anyone defended the soldiers and members of Mexico’s navy who also suffered abuse. “And you guys that do human rights against this, what about the dignity of them …” The message contained a link, presumably to a news story or a tip. Intrigued, Ms. Brewer clicked on it. She was directed to a broken link, a telltale sign of the malware. “It’s just part of defending human rights in Mexico,” she said. “It comes with the territory.”","MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted by advanced spyware sold to the Mexican government on the condition that it be used only to investigate criminals and terrorists.

All were infected with Pegasus, which is made by Israel’s NSO Group, according to digital forensic experts working for them or their organizations. In one case, a journalist was notified recently that his phone had been hacked using the software; he received an email from Apple saying that someone might have gained access to data stored on his device after downloading what appeared to be a fake version of WhatsApp, the popular messaging app. It was unclear whether any information had actually been extracted during this episode. But all told, more than 10 people said they believed they had been infected at some point since last year, even though they did nothing wrong. “I feel like I am under surveillance,” said Carmen Aristegui, a well-known television anchorwoman whose cellphone number has long been publicly available through her show’s website. She learned about the potential breach when she saw news reports about how several other high-profile Mexicans had apparently also been hit. Her husband, David Ruiz Soto, a former editorial director at El Universal newspaper, got the same warning as Mr. Aristegui. “It makes me very nervous because we are living in a country where there is so much violence against journalism,” she added. A lawyer for Ms. Aristegui declined to comment. The revelations come amid growing concern over the use of technology by governments around the world to track dissidents and critics. Last month, Amnesty International reported that the United Arab Emirates had purchased the software from NSO, and that its agents had repeatedly attacked the phones of political opponents and others considered enemies of the state. Now, the list includes Mexico, which is widely regarded as having among Latin America’s worst records of press freedom and civil liberties violations. For years, President Enrique Peña Nieto has faced criticism over corrupt practices within his administration. He has vowed to crack down on crime and drug trafficking but has failed to make significant progress. His approval ratings remain low, and many Mexicans believe he is too close to business interests tied to organized crime. Mr. Peña Nieto has denied involvement in illegal wiretapping. And officials say the purchase of such tools does not necessarily mean that those being monitored are guilty of anything. Still, the revelations could further tarnish the president’s image and damage efforts to improve relations between the United States and Mexico. At least three of the cases involve Americans: Javier Sicilia, the founder of the Movement for Peace With Justice and Dignity, which advocated for peaceful solutions to the war on drugs; Lydia Cacho Ribeiro, a writer and women’s rights defender who fled Mexico after receiving death threats; and Kathryn Stone, an attorney based in Houston who represents families of people killed by the police in Tamaulipas State. Two of these cases involved attempts to get hold of information related to criminal investigations, including possible links between members of the Mexican military and cartels. One of the journalists, Miguel Ángel Bojorquez, wrote articles about allegedly shady real estate deals involving relatives of top security officials. Another journalist, Rafael Cabrera, focused on the disappearances of the Ayotzinapa teachers college students. Both men said they suspected they may have been spied upon before they began reporting on specific stories. They both said they were aware of the possibility that they would be watched, given the nature of their work. But neither knew they were being targeted until alerted by researchers hired by their employer, Proceso magazine. “We don’t know why our telephones were selected, but we do know that we were chosen,” Mr. Cabrera said. “The question now becomes, ‘How far will they go? What can they find out if they already have my messages and calls?’” Mr. Bojorquez said he felt betrayed by the federal government. “They want us to think that they care about transparency and democracy while they are doing things behind closed doors.” On Thursday evening, a group of academ ics, human rights activists and lawyers gathered outside the offices of the Attorney General’s Office in Mexico City to protest the apparent abuse of power. Some carried signs reading, “Stop Spying!” Others held up photos of the victims of recent killings by the authorities. Many expressed anger over the lack of accountability. “There needs to be justice here,” said Laura Zúñiga, executive director of Article 27, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting free expression online. “If you break the laws , there should be consequences.” The gathering was organized after reports surfaced that the Mexican government had been spying on journalists, activists and politicians — including those who were critical of President Enrique Peña Nieto or his administration. It is unclear how much information has actually been collected about these people; officials have denied any improper surveillance activities. But the revelations have added fuel to an already raging debate in this country: whether Mr. Peña Nieto’s administration can be trusted with its handling of sensitive personal data. In response to the controversies, he announced last weekend that he would create an independent commission to investigate allegations of illegal wiretapping under previous administrations. He also vowed to strengthen privacy protections for Mexicans. Yet critics say it will take more than new legislation to restore public confidence in the president and his party. They point out that Mr. Peña Nieto has yet to deliver on many promises made during his campaign two years ago, when he pledged to fight corruption and improve transparency. And they question why it took so long for him to address what some see as a major breach of civil liberties. “This shows us once again that we cannot rely on our institutions,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “We need to build mechanisms whereby citizens themselves are able to hold their governments accountable.” Last year, the United States Department of Justice disclosed that American agents working abroad sometimes intercept communications from foreign leaders without notifying them first, citing national security concerns. That news prompted widespread condemnation among Latin Americans, especially because of the region’s history of military dictatorships. Now, similar accusations against the Peña Nieto administration have emerged in Mexico, which has a troubled past involving disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions. Over the past few weeks, several local media organizations reported that the Federal Investigative Agency (AFI), part of the attorney general’s office, had monitored phone calls, e-mail messages and social network exchanges between journalists, activist groups, opposition political parties and others. The AFI did not respond to requests for comment. On Wednesday, however, Ricardo Mejía Domínguez, secretary of legal affairs within the attorney general’s office, acknowledged that the agency had conducted such operations but insisted they followed proper procedures. Among other things, he said, all monitoring was approved by judges beforehand. Still, many remain unconvinced. As Ms. Zúñiga pointed out, the fact that the court approvals came only recently suggests that the practice may have gone on longer than previously thought. Moreover, she noted, the courts rarely reject applications submitted by the federal prosecutor’s office. Other questions include exactly whom the AFI targeted, how often it operated and whether the agency ever tapped into conversations related to criminal investigations. So far, no one knows the answers to those queries. According to documents leaked earlier this month, the AFI used software called CIPAV, developed by Israel’s NSO Group, to collect mobile telephone numbers linked to specific users and then track their movements through cellular networks. While the company says its products allow clients to identify terrorism suspects, criminals and drug traffickers, the software apparently could also be employed to keep tabs on innocent civilians. This was demonstrated most dramatically in August, when Amnesty International obtained evidence showing that the Israeli firm had provided intelligence services in Egypt with tools capable of tracking down dissidents and human rights workers. One report showed that the technology helped police officers arrest Ahmed Abdullah Hussein Doma, a prominent blogger known as Sandmonkey, along with seven other members of the group April 6 Youth Movement. All eight men were detained for nearly three months until being released in November. Afterward, the bloggers accused the Egyptian government of using sophisticated digital espionage techniques to stifle freedom of speech.",LLaMa2,True,
11,"WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority. “Oh, Drumstick, I think, is going to be very happy.” It ended with characteristic introspection. “I feel so good about myself,” the president said softly, appraising his own clemency, laying a hand on the bird after seeking permission to touch it from turkey professionals. Mr. Trump looked upon the crowd in the Rose Garden and announced his decision: The animal was hereby pardoned for the crime of being born a turkey. Such was Mr. Trump’s inaugural take on a Washington tradition that seems to exist mostly because it existed the year before, a sort of “Apprentice” for the long-necked set, superimposed on the White House for a statelier feel. “Very special people, a very special country,” Mr. Trump summarized, a bit mechanically, before heading off to Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday. Yet if some presidents have slogged through the more ceremonial elements of the office — grimacing through regrettable puns written by aides, counting the seconds until they could return to federal duties that did not include standoffish poultry — Mr. Trump appeared perhaps more comfortable than usual, unburdened by forces beyond his jurisdiction. So much of the job has frustrated him, by his own account. He cannot intervene in Justice Department affairs, he has lamented. He cannot browbeat lawmakers into affirming his agenda. Here is something he can control: This turkey lives. Other turkeys die. It is so ordered. “They say, ‘Enough talk,’” Mr. Trump said at one point, imagining an internal monologue for Drumstick and a peer, Wishbone, who was apparently spared off-camera. “‘Please pardon us.’” For about eight minutes, Mr. Trump seemed to forget about Russia-tinged investigations, about congressional gear-grinding, about college basketball players (or the relatives of college basketball players) showing insufficient gratitude for his efforts. He marveled at the size of Drumstick (“Thirty-six pounds — that’s a big bird”), admired the animal’s appearance (“beautiful turkey”), praised the spot where the turkey would settle (“Gobbler’s Rest, beautiful place”) and the university that houses it (“Virginia Tech, tremendous school”). He mentioned Pennsylvania without interrupting himself to note that he had carried the state in a surprise result last year. He joked that he had been advised against seeking to reverse the pardons of Tater and Tot, the last turkeys given their reprieve under President Barack Obama. “As many of you know, I have been very active in overturning a number of executive actions by my predecessor,” Mr. Trump said. “However, I have been informed by the White House Counsel’s Office that Tater and Tot’s pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked.” Mr. Trump has stocked his tenure with disarming moments of presidential pageantry, often infusing photo ops with such telling asides: complaining about the news media to the Halloween-costumed children of the news media; looking into an eclipse without protective eyewear because he could not resist; sliding behind the wheel of a giant truck on the White House lawn because it seemed like fun. And with Mr. Trump, subtext often has a way of becoming text. There was at least some expectation on Tuesday that he might let fly an ill-conceived groaner about the wisdom of retaining a pardon or two for later, with a special counsel inquiry shadowing his administration. That was not to be. Flanked in the Rose Garden by his wife, Melania, and his youngest son, Barron — with a guest list that also included his daughters Ivanka and Tiffany and his son-in-law Jared Kushner — Mr. Trump wished American families well, thanked military and law enforcement personnel and approached the animal. “Are you ready, Drumstick?” he asked. “O.K.?” He pardoned the bird and began clapping at his act. Others followed. Drumstick began gobbling a bit, tilting its neck back to take it all in. Mr. Trump turned to shake a few hands, when a shout pierced the low hum of pleasantries. “Are you going to pardon any people?” cried a voice near the back, beside a row of cameras. The president smiled, and kept on shaking.","WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority.","WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority. : pardoning two turkeys at the White House for Thanksgiving dinner. But as the president stepped up to the lectern and pulled back his right arm to deliver the traditional presidential pardon to one turkey and then another, a commotion broke out in the crowd behind him. A woman wearing an orange knit cap, her face obscured by sunglasses, began shouting at the top of her lungs. The Secret Service agents who were there quickly rushed over to escort the protester away. As they did so, she continued to scream and shout. Then a man began yelling in response, saying that “Trump is not my president.” And then another person started chanting in protest of the pardons: “No justice! No peace!” “Hey hey ho ho Donald Trump has got to go!” That last chant was repeated again and again. As it went on, a small group of protesters gathered outside the fence surrounding the South Lawn, holding signs. One read: “Pardon me? I don’t want your turkey.” Another said: “Thanksgiving is about family, friends and food not hate and fear.” But inside, the scene was far less chaotic than what unfolded in front of the cameras. Afterward, some people said that the commotion had been orchestrated. Others insisted it was spontaneous, but that the agents should have known better than to let someone into such close proximity of Mr. Trump. Still others wondered if there was any truth at all to the idea that a planned demonstration was taking place outside. (The Trump campaign denied the existence of any organized protests.) For many Americans, this year will mark their first time observing a holiday without George W. Bush or Barack Obama in charge. In recent years, both presidents had used their annual pardoning power as opportunities to highlight causes dear to them and honor individuals who exemplified those values. But with Mr. Obama leaving office last Friday and with no successor yet elected to replace him, there was little reason for anyone in Washington to expect anything different from the current administration, which has made clear its disdain for much of President Obama’s legacy. So when word spread on Monday evening that the two birds would soon meet their fate, it seemed like just another example of how little things are likely to change under the new regime. The two male gobblers had already spent more than six months living on borrowed time, having survived the first round of presidential clemency in January and the second round in October. They had also endured a long journey to get there, flying all the way from Minnesota’s Le Sueur County before being transported by motorcade to the National Turkey Federation headquarters near Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning. There, the turkeys had met the other two members of their species in residence: Butterball and Nugget, two female hens from North Carolina that have lived together since last summer. In addition to the turkeys’ names and genders, there was a third fact about these three that the public might find surprising: All three have had their own Twitter accounts. The two male turkeys had more followers, about 15,000 each, while Nugget has only around 2,500 followers, according to a spokeswoman for the turkey federation, Julie DeYoung. Butterball was ineligible to tweet because of federal regulations governing poultry production. Ms. DeYoung, the turkey federation spokeswoman, said she was unaware of the accounts until after they appeared online on Monday night. She added that she believed that the turkeys themselves had created the accounts and said the organization would investigate whether there were violations of any rules regarding government employees using social media accounts to promote political messages. “We will look into whether the accounts violated any laws and policies, including ethics,” Ms. DeYoung said. “If we determine any violation occurred, appropriate action will be taken, consistent with our mission to support agriculture, education, research, and community outreach programs.” The pardons themselves were a relatively straightforward affair, although the White House press secretary Sean Spicer did manage to make some news himself. He announced that Mr. Trump was granting a full 50-pound reprieve for Gobbler Number Two. The president also granted a 40-pound reprieve for Number Three, but Mr. Trump did not announce what the bird weighed. “I think that the president has done something very good today for all turkeys, including those two who are here in attendance,” Mr. Spicer told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. He added, however, that “the turkeys will still end up getting eaten” by millions of families across the country. Mr. Trump did not mention the protesters during his remarks, nor was he asked any questions about the incident by journalists covering him. Instead, Mr. Spicer focused his attention on what Mr. Trump called “a great day for America, a great day for freedom.” But Mr. Spicer, too, did not seem entirely sure of how to respond. He said that he was still trying to understand the details of what had happened in Charlottesville and said he would have more information later in the afternoon. Mr. Spicer’s comments came as President Obama issued an impassioned statement condemning white supremacists and neo-Nazis who were protesting against removing Confederate monuments from public spaces, saying they had no place in American society and calling them domestic terrorists. The president also condemned those who opposed their removal and called their actions reprehensible. He also praised law enforcement officials in Virginia, where two state police officers died after being struck by vehicles during protests over the weekend, for protecting protesters from violence. In his remarks, Mr. Trump also took aim at the news media. “We are living through very difficult times,” he said. “The level of dishonesty is out there like never before. I don’t know if it has ever been this bad before.” In the days since Saturday’s rally in Charlottesville, which left one person dead after clashes between counterprotesters and supporters of Confederate statues erupted into violent confrontations, the White House has struggled to explain why it initially seemed reluctant to condemn white nationalists or disavow groups with ties to racism and anti-Semitism. On Monday morning, as the administration faced growing criticism, the president tweeted: “I am pleased that my statements yesterday made clear that we must all come together as Americans for peace and harmony.” In response to the president, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, tweeted, “Mr. President, you can say whatever you want to try to distract us, but your words matter.” And Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democratic member of the intelligence committee investigating Russia’s interference in last year’s presidential election, wrote: “If the President doesn’t believe Nazis should be denounced, then he shouldn’t be our Commander in Chief.” On Tuesday afternoon, as he departed Washington en route to New Jersey, President Trump told reporters he believed he had done enough, and that it was time to move forward. Asked whether Mr. Spicer had adequately explained his initial reluctance, he replied, “No,” adding, “But that was a long answer. That wasn’t short, right?” “It was not good.” “You could see when people got up and started talking — I think he handled himself well,” Mr. Trump added. “He knows exactly what happened. It wasn’t hard for me to figure out, because you saw some pretty rough stuff. You know what happened? We didn’t get along so well. We weren’t getting along.” In his first appearance as press secretary, Sean M.Spicer, who worked closely with Mr. Trump in the campaign and transition period, had seemed ill prepared for the job, unable to provide basic answers on the most pressing issues facing the country and struggling to convey even simple messages clearly. But he had appeared confident and comfortable when speaking to reporters in recent weeks about Mr. Trump’s agenda and policy proposals, including health care legislation that failed in Congress earlier this month, and had been able to deflect most inquiries about Mr. Trump and other controversies by pointing out how poorly former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton performed under similar circumstances as she sought the presidency. At a briefing at 2 p.m., Mr. Spicer seemed more relaxed than usual and more forthcoming. He acknowledged the difficulty of explaining why the president seemed hesitant to denounce hate crimes committed in his name and said Mr. Trump was working with aides to craft a message that reflected the full range of the nation’s political spectrum. “There’s no question that we need a better way to communicate to make sure the entire country understands that he unequivocally condemns these acts and everything else that goes on with hatred,” Mr. Spicer said. But he was less certain about why it took Mr. Trump so long to speak out against the white nationalist demonstrators. “He’s going to continue to work with members of both parties, both sides, and see how best he can unify us as a country,” Mr. Spicer said, adding, “This isn’t something he wants to talk about every single day. This was something where he felt strongly.” Asked what Mr. Trump thought when he heard the chants of the crowd on television, Mr. Spicer responded: “That’s what we need to find out. That’s what the investigation will tell us.” “But that doesn’t mean you should just jump to conclusions,” he said.",Falcon,True,
12,"A jury in San Diego on Thursday rejected claims by a law graduate, Anna Alaburda, that the Thomas Jefferson School of Law enticed her to enroll by using misleading graduate employment figures. In the first — and perhaps last — such case to reach the courtroom, Ms. Alaburda, 37, argued that the school reported a higher percentage of its graduates landed jobs after graduation than was actually the case, and that she relied on the bogus data to choose to attend the school. After amassing more than $150,000 in debt to graduate in 2008, she has been unable to find a full-time, salaried job as a lawyer, she says. A jury voted nine to three to reject her claims. Still, unlike more than a dozen other disgruntled lawyers who have tried but failed to bring their former law schools to trial for counting their graduates’ post-degree jobs such as waitresses and bartenders as full-time legal employment, Ms. Alaburda survived attempts over the past five years to sink her case. Thomas Jefferson stood by its employment figures. Its lawyer, Michael Sullivan, argued that earning a law degree was not a guarantee of a well-paying job. “I’m not here to tell you a law degree is a guarantee of career success, is a guarantee of riches,” Mr. Sullivan told the jury. “It’s not. No degree is.” At trial in San Diego Superior Court this month, Ms. Alaburda said she chose Thomas Jefferson after consulting popular law school guides, including the 2004 edition of best graduate schools by U.S. News & World Report. The San Diego school’s listing said that just over 80 percent of its graduates were employed nine months after they graduated. “I knew it wasn’t as competitive as first- or second-tier law schools, but it still had pretty decent statistics and was A.B.A. accredited,” she told the jury. “So I thought it was a pretty decent school to apply to.” Other law school graduates, citing six-figure debt and misleading employment data, have tried to hold law schools around the country accountable. About 15 such lawsuits were derailed before they reached a jury. Ms. Alaburda, who invoked California state fraud protections, was the first to get her case before a jury even though a judge earlier rejected her effort to certify her claim as a class-action lawsuit, with potentially high-dollar damage awards. Ms. Alaburda, who has worked in a series of part-time legal support jobs, asked for $125,000 for lost wages and reimbursement of tuition and fees. Entry-level legal jobs began shrinking after the 2008 economic slowdown, and law graduates were left saddled with six-figure debt loads and limited job prospects. Since then, the American Bar Association has been taking steps to require law schools to be more open about postgraduate job placement. While the 200-plus accredited law schools must now publish a more detailed breakdown of their employment data, including whether jobs are full time or part time, critics said the jury’s decision lets schools off the hook. “At the time, law schools systematically deceived students with misleading statistics, with the blessing of the American Bar Association,” said Kyle McEntee, executive director of Law School Transparency, a nonprofit that campaigns to hold law schools accountable. The jury was asked to decide whether the school intentionally misrepresented the employment statistics or was simply negligent. Brian A. Procel, Ms. Alaburda’s lawyer, said the school did not reveal that its employment figures included such work as a pool cleaner, waitress or sales clerk, and that they were based on a small sample of graduates. Thomas Jefferson employees maintained that they did not understand the importance of the employment data, and that the school was a nonprofit institution offering opportunities to students who might not have other options to attend law school. Mr. Procel said those assertions were contradicted by correspondence indicating that law school employees knew that the graduate employment figures affected the law school’s national ranking — which, in turn, helped burnish the school’s credibility and draw more students to enroll. Judges in Illinois, Michigan and New York, where similar cases were filed, have generally concluded that law students opted for legal education at their own peril and were sophisticated enough to have known that employment as a lawyer was not guaranteed. A lawsuit against Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco was settled last year, with five graduates being awarded about $8,000 each. Thomas Guernsey, the dean of Thomas Jefferson, said, “Today’s decision by the jury further validates our unwavering commitment to providing our students with the knowledge, skills and tools necessary to excel as law students, pass the bar exam and succeed in their professional careers.” Mr. Procel said he hoped the case would help ensure that future students “have access to better information when deciding to attend college or graduate school.” Ms. Alaburda declined to comment.","A jury in San Diego on Thursday rejected claims by a law graduate, Anna Alaburda, that the Thomas Jefferson School of Law enticed her to enroll by using misleading graduate employment figures.

The verdict came as other schools are facing similar accusations from former students who say they were duped into paying tuition for degrees that did not prepare them well enough for careers or adequately help them repay their student loans. But this is believed to be only the second time any legal dispute involving false job placement statistics has gone before jurors; most cases have been settled out of court. “I’m relieved,” said Jeffrey L. Thomas, an attorney representing TJSL against Ms. Alaburda. He added: “We believe there will be more litigation.” Mr. Thomas declined to comment further because he had signed a confidentiality agreement. Ms. Alaburda, whose name is also spelled Alaburdha, represented herself during much of the trial but hired two lawyers at key points when the judge decided it would be appropriate. She told jurors that she attended TJSL between 2015 and 2018, borrowing $94,674 through federal financial aid programs to do so. After graduating cum laude, she passed the California bar examination in February 2018. That same month, however, she began working part-time for less money than she made while studying full time at TJLS. Her goal now is to get back all the money she spent going to law school. According to the National Association for Law Placement, which collects information about postgraduate employment rates among American law schools, the average rate for TJSL’s class of 2018 was just under 60 percent. By comparison, the national figure for private institutions like TJLS is around 66 percent. For public universities, including state colleges, the rate averages nearly 75 percent. During closing arguments Wednesday morning, Judge Michael D. Libensky reminded jurors that they must decide whether the allegedly inflated numbers caused Ms. Alaburda harm. If they find no damage, then the claim fails. “If you don’t think anything happened here, I can tell you right away what your answer should be,” he said. Juror No. 2, a woman named Kathleen, asked if she could take notes during deliberations. When the judge said yes, Kathleen pulled out a small spiral pad and started writing down questions. At one point, another juror, a man identified only as John, suggested that the questionnaire sent to prospective students might contain some of the answers needed. “It doesn’t matter how many times we read it,” he said. “They never answered those questions directly.” On Monday afternoon, Ms. Alaburda took the stand and testified that she wanted to become a lawyer since childhood. She graduated magna cum laude from Stony Brook University in New York in 2008 with a degree in psychology. She worked briefly as a paralegal assistant before deciding to go to law school. She applied to five different schools, including Harvard, Columbia and Georgetown Universities. While applying to these top-ranked schools, she received emails from admissions officers at TJLS assuring her that the school was committed to helping her succeed academically and financially once admitted. “The email I got from them sounded very personalized,” she said. “This really felt like my dream school.” She chose TJLS based partly on the fact that it offered scholarships up front rather than waiting until later in the admission process. It also promised to give her access to alumni mentoring opportunities. Ultimately, she paid $17,000 per year for three years, totaling almost $51,000. She ended up taking out roughly $94,000 worth of student loan debts, according to testimony. In addition to being ranked near the bottom of law schools nationwide, TJLS has faced numerous complaints in recent months about poor academic performance and high levels of stress. Last week, the United States Department of Education announced plans to investigate the school following reports by several news organizations. Among other things, the department may look into claims that TJSL misrepresented its job placement data. A representative for the university declined to comment on the case. Throughout the trial, the defense argued that the school does not guarantee jobs upon graduation. Rather, it offers career services assistance — such as resume reviews and interview preparation — to anyone who asks. They noted that Ms. Alaburda did not avail herself of these resources after graduation. “She didn’t even ask for help,” said Mr. McNamara in his closing arguments. But Ms. Alaburda testified during her deposition that she was never informed about the resources available at the law school or how they could be accessed. She also claimed that a counselor told her there were no full-time positions open at the time she graduated. The judge is expected to issue a ruling within 60 days.
The post Law School Graduate Sues Over Job Placement Claims appeared first on New York Times. . WASHINGTON — President Trump’s decision to replace the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, with John F. Kelley was an extraordinary act that underscored how much power Mr. Trump has concentrated in his own hands and how little he trusts those around him. The move came after a tumultuous week for the administration during which Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had been publicly criticized by some senior officials; Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced into recusing himself from any investigations involving Russia because of his contacts with Russian diplomats before taking office; and Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort surrendered to federal authorities on charges related to money laundering and tax fraud. On Monday morning, Mr. Kelly, who is known as “the general,” arrived at the West Wing wearing camouflage fatigues and carrying a duffel bag full of clothes and personal items. He met briefly with the president in the Oval Office but did not stay long enough to meet other top advisers or Cabinet members. Instead, he went straight upstairs to see Mr. Priebus, whom he replaced. Aides said they were told only minutes earlier that Mr. Priebus would be fired. In a statement announcing Mr. Priebus’ departure, Mr. Trump praised him as having done a great job but made no mention of Mr. Kelly, whose appointment he announced just hours later. By late afternoon, Mr. Priebus had left the building through a side door and gone home without saying goodbye to colleagues. But Mr. Kelly, 67, a retired Marine Corps four-star general who served two tours of duty in Iraq, quickly moved into place. After meeting privately with the president, he began making phone calls to key players like Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and majority leader, asking them to give their support. And then, within hours, he held a news conference where he pledged loyalty to the president and promised to restore order to the chaotic West Wing. It was clear early on Tuesday that the changeover was going smoothly: Mr. Kelly was seen entering the White House residence to greet Mrs. Trump and her daughter Ivanka Trump, who are both there while their father is away in Europe. Mr. Kelly also spoke warmly about the first lady, telling reporters she had helped make the transition easier than it might have otherwise been. As he took over as chief of staff, Mr. Kelly became one of the most powerful people in Washington. His new role will put him in charge of all aspects of running the executive branch, including setting priorities among competing demands. He will work closely with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who now serves as a kind of shadow chief of staff, along with Stephen Miller, another close confidant of the president. Both men will report directly to Mr. Kelly. While Mr. Kelly may try to impose more discipline inside the White House, he could face resistance from allies of Mr. Priebus, many of whom remain in important positions, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Some of these officials have already expressed reservations about Mr. Trump’s recent actions, such as firing off Twitter messages attacking lawmakers. Still, Mr. Kelly is expected to be welcomed by Republicans eager to contain the damage caused by Mr. Priebus’ failure to assert control over a mercurial boss. One reason for optimism is that Mr. Kelly shares Mr. Trump’s instinctive dislike of leaks and believes strongly in keeping secrets. That trait should help keep information flowing between the West Wing and Capitol Hill when Congress returns next month. Mr. Kelly will also bring military experience that can help guide Mr. Trump toward decisions on matters like North Korea and Afghanistan, where he has shown interest in sending additional troops. But he faces challenges of his own. Mr. Kelly has never worked in government before and must learn the ropes fast if he hopes to prevent further embarrassments. If he does not succeed, Mr. Trump’s presidency could suffer even greater damage. For now, though, Mr. Trump seems pleased with the outcome. He tweeted Wednesday night: “General John Kelly is doing a fantastic job as Chief of Staff. Greatest assets @WhiteHouse! #MAGA.” The choice of Mr. Kelly surprised many observers since he seemed unlikely to get past the vetting process given his lack of political experience.

13,"In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass. Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate. On Monday, the Department of Justice sued to block AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, a deal that would unite one of the country’s biggest internet providers with the company that owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film studio. It was a signal from antitrust enforcers that an era of breakneck consolidation might be coming to an end, and that mergers would be evaluated by a new set of standards. Then on Tuesday morning, the Federal Communications Commission announced plans to dismantle net neutrality rules. The move would let companies charge higher fees and block access to some websites, and was effectively a green light for big internet service providers — including AT&T — to freely wield their influence against rivals. In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies. But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future. “We have one government, but two separate agencies with opposing views,” said Spencer Kurn, an analyst at New Street Research. “You’ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there’s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else’s.” At the intersection of both debates is AT&T. A global powerhouse offering access to the internet through mobile phones and landlines, and satellite television service through DirecTV, AT&T has a long history of battling regulators. In 1982, it agreed to break itself up and end a nearly century-old monopoly. In 2011, regulators scuttled its proposed deal to acquire T-Mobile. Randall L. Stephenson, the AT&T chief executive, has vowed to fight the Justice Department in court to save the Time Warner deal. AT&T stands to gain from the rollback of net neutrality rules. It could charge companies and consumers more for high-speed internet access, and use its market influence to hinder content providers it competes against. “It’s an ‘open the champagne bottles’ moment for AT&T,” said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University who coined the term net neutrality — the concept of providing equal access to the internet. “They can just tell people to pony up.” But AT&T’s long-term aspirations could be dealt a severe blow if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking its takeover of Time Warner. On Tuesday, President Trump signaled his approval of the lawsuit. “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country,” he said in response to a question from reporters. If the merger was approved, he suggested, “I think your pricing is going to go up.” For all the good a rollback of net neutrality rules would do AT&T, the company is looking to diversify. Its core businesses of delivering phone, internet and satellite television services are maturing. A big move into the content business would expand the company’s sources of revenue, and give it new opportunities for cost savings. One of AT&T’s biggest competitors, Comcast, has already married content and distribution with the acquisition of NBCUniversal. If the government succeeds in preventing the Time Warner deal, it will raise sharp questions about the future of AT&T, and its competitors. “This could be a watershed event for future business combinations in media,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. “Does this mean Comcast will be broken up?” There is no evidence that the decisions by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. were coordinated. “I do not think it is a well-thought-out, cohesive policy that is coming from the executive office,” said Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Instead, the diverging decisions reflect an effort by different agencies trying to come to grips with a radically transformed media and telecommunications landscape, one where Silicon Valley companies are suddenly powerhouses in content creation, and traditional media companies exert vast influence over how information flows across the internet. “We’re definitely getting mixed messages from the administration,” said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University. The Justice Department’s decision to intervene in the AT&T deal was the more surprising of the two developments this week. Many antitrust experts believe that the government’s case against the deal is weak, because it is a so-called vertical merger, bringing together two businesses that do not compete directly with each other. But the lawsuit is a sign that the Justice Department is beginning to think about antitrust enforcement in fundamentally new ways. The decision by the F.C.C. to roll back net neutrality rules was less surprising, but has equally far-reaching implications. With less regulation, big internet providers will be able to charge more for their services, extract new fees from websites and block content. “The F.C.C. is saying that they’re going to give up any legal authority over regulating high-speed internet,” said Susan Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School. “They’re handing the power to choose winners and losers online to about five companies.” Despite the seeming irreconcilability of the moves by the Justice Department and the F.C.C., some see a common narrative in the two decisions. “They’re both defense strategies against Silicon Valley,” Mr. Wu said. By rolling back net neutrality, the government is giving old-school media companies like AT&T and Comcast more leverage over companies like Netflix, Google and Facebook that are increasingly becoming their competitors. And by challenging the AT&T merger with Time Warner, the Justice Department could be laying the groundwork for a new approach to antitrust enforcement that could be used to go after big technology firms. Barry Diller, the media mogul and chairman of IAC, which owns a host of websites including Match.com and Vimeo, cited the power of tech companies in expressing exasperation at the Justice Department suit. “If you think AT&T has too much market power because of distribution, tell me what happens if you are Facebook and Google, which have unbelievable concentration in distribution,” Mr. Diller said. “How would you ever be able to get a content addition to Google?” And there is another school of thought suggesting that more vigorous antitrust enforcement might have obviated the need for net neutrality rules in the first place. If regulators had been stricter about ensuring robust competition among internet service providers over the years, the theory goes, big firms like AT&T would not be able to operate in ways that harm competition. “Net neutrality was a distant-second-best remedy,” Mr. Sagers said. “If we could have competition in internet service provision, that would have been way better than relying on the F.C.C.” Even if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking AT&T’s deal for Time Warner, the opportunity to use antitrust enforcement as a means to give consumers more choice among internet providers has likely passed. And now, by unwinding net neutrality rules, Mr. Sagers said, the Trump administration will make it easier for big companies like AT&T to maintain the already enormous power it has amassed through earlier consolidation. “If you want to have a monopoly,” he said, “the government can be your best friend.”","In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass.

Last year, more than half were minorities who at some point had been treated in prison mental health programs, according to the Times analysis, where consultants and lawyers have pushed more aggressively to exploit the looser fund-raising rules that have fueled the rise of super PACs, unleashed by the Citizens United decision, have become de facto campaign arms, increasingly undertaking the core costs — advertising, polling and travel, for example — once assumed by candidates, who are limited to raising $2,700 per donor. “The 2016 presidential candidates and their individual-candidate super PACs are wiping out the nation’s power plants.

But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump’s military threats against North Korea have caught Beijing’s attention, Mr. Revere said. But he added, “That possibility is not there at this time.” For now, the fight is theoretical. Congress has barred the Food and Drug Administration favored approval of the drug, flibanserin, for women whose lack of sexual desire was not attributable to other causes such as disease or relationship troubles, providing that certain steps were taken to limit the risks of the drug.

The case was major news in Norway. The records examined by The Times indicate that the F.B.I. has long-running, open-ended “enterprise” investigations into groups that pose a threat to public safety.

14,"WASHINGTON — After weeks of uncertainty atop the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Trump dismissed its secretary, David J. Shulkin, on Wednesday and announced he would replace him with the White House physician, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. If confirmed, Dr. Jackson, a career Naval officer who has no real experience running a large bureaucracy, would inherit a set of challenges that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican administrations alike. The department, the federal government’s second largest, has been burdened for years by aging infrastructure, an inefficient health care system and an unwieldy 360,000-person work force. He could also quickly face crucial, multibillion-dollar decisions over the replacement of its outdated computerized records system and legislation that would ease the rules around veterans seeking private health care at government expense. The announcement punctuated what has been a rapid fall from favor for Dr. Shulkin, a politically moderate former hospital executive who delivered Mr. Trump a string of bipartisan legislative victories at a time when he was struggling to find them. But in his final weeks, he struggled to fight off attempts by more conservative administration officials to have him removed and was dogged by an unflattering inspector general report on his overseas travel that undermined his relationship with the president. Dr. Shulkin’s departure was the latest chapter in the remaking of Mr. Trump’s team of senior advisers, a shake-up that has led to the replacement of the secretary of state, the director of the C.I.A. and the national security adviser, along with White House aides. In the midst of that turmoil, Dr. Jackson, 50, who was named to his current position by President Barack Obama in 2013, has grown close with Mr. Trump, a commander in chief who enjoys familiar faces in his orbit and often rewards them with new roles. Dr. Jackson had a rare turn in the spotlight in January, when he announced the results of Mr. Trump’s physical, his first while in office, and addressed speculation over the president’s physical and mental health. The president was very pleased with the performance. “I’ve found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” Dr. Jackson said. His policy views are all but unknown, though, especially on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will decide whether he is up to leading the department. Senators, including Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, issued cautious statements on Wednesday praising Dr. Shulkin and indicating that they would need to get to know the nominee. That tone was echoed by mainstream veterans groups like Disabled American Veterans and the American Legion, who hold considerable sway in Washington, and who warned of a potential leadership vacuum at the department. Privately, several White House aides acknowledged that Dr. Jackson’s lack of managerial experience could be problematic and said that once again the president’s interest in his personal bond with someone was more significant than their curriculum vitae. In a Twitter post on Wednesday announcing the changes, Mr. Trump called Dr. Jackson “highly respected” and thanked Dr. Shulkin for “service to our country and to our great veterans.” Mr. Trump said that Robert Wilkie, the under secretary for defense personnel and readiness at the Defense Department, would serve as acting secretary in the meantime, bypassing the department’s deputy secretary, Thomas G. Bowman. The White House did not respond to a request asking who would replace Dr. Jackson. Dr. Shulkin, who served as under secretary of veterans affairs in the Obama administration, had begun to make headway on some of the department’s most persistent problems. Those included an expansion of the G.I. Bill for post-9/11 veterans, legislation that makes it easier for the department to remove bad employees and a law that streamlines the appeals process for veterans seeking disability benefits. Those successes and his easy grasp of complicated policy issues won Dr. Shulkin deep support on Capitol Hill and among veterans groups. And Mr. Trump, who made veterans issues and overhauling the scandal-ridden department a focal point of his campaign, showered Dr. Shulkin with praise. At a bill-signing ceremony in June, the president teased that the secretary need never worry about hearing his “Apprentice”-era catchphrase, “You’re fired.” “We’ll never have to use those words on our David,” Mr. Trump said. “We will never use those words on you, that’s for sure.” But in recent months, a group of conservative Trump administration appointees at the White House and the department began to break with the secretary and plot his ouster. At issue was how far and how fast to privatize health care for veterans, a long-sought goal for conservatives like the Koch brothers. The officials — who included Dr. Shulkin’s press secretary and assistant secretary for communications, along with a top White House domestic policy aide — came to consider Dr. Shulkin and his top deputy as obstacles. The secretary’s troubles only grew when what had been an internal power struggle burst into the open in February, after the department’s inspector general issued a scathing report on a trip Dr. Shulkin took last year to Britain and Denmark. The report, describing what it called “serious derelictions,” found the secretary had spent much of the trip sightseeing and had improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift. Critics of the secretary seized on the report to try to hasten his removal. Dr. Shulkin, fearing a coup, went public with a warning about officials “trying to undermine the department from within” and cut off those he saw as disloyal. The efforts backfired. At the White House, senior officials came to believe that Dr. Shulkin had misled them about the contents of the report. And the secretary’s public declarations only further aggravated top officials, who felt Dr. Shulkin had gone too far in commenting on internal politics with news outlets and had opened the administration to sharp criticism over his trip to Europe, which the report said cost more than $122,000. But as recently as early March, after meetings with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Dr. Shulkin publicly claimed victory, signaling that he had the White House’s support to remove officials opposing him. The victory was short-lived. Before long, Dr. Shulkin sharply curtailed his public profile, cutting off communications with reporters and isolating himself from top deputies he viewed as disloyal. People who have spoken with the secretary in recent days said he was determined to keep his post, even as it became increasingly clear his time was up. He was set to meet with leaders from the nation’s largest veterans groups on Thursday. Despite his problems with the White House, Dr. Shulkin remained overwhelmingly popular on Capitol Hill, where the Senate unanimously confirmed him last year, and among the veterans groups that have traditionally held outsize influence in Washington. In recent weeks, leaders from both parties publicly and privately signaled their support, even as rumors of his replacement appeared in news reports. But Mr. Trump had had enough. He began to discuss successors in recent weeks, even considering  Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a possibility. He told friends last weekend that he would fire Dr. Shulkin, it was just a question of when. Dr. Shulkin had made a preliminary inquiry about having Dr. Jackson for an under secretary role last year, and the president spoke with him briefly about it then, one senior administration official said. But it went nowhere at the time. By Monday, Mr. Trump had started animatedly talking with a handful of people about the idea of Dr. Jackson’s replacing Dr. Shulkin, people familiar with the discussions said. Still, he did not tell many advisers of his plan until soon before it was announced. A Navy doctor since 1995, Dr. Jackson deployed as an emergency medicine physician to Taqaddum, Iraq, during the Iraq war. He has served as a member of the White House medical unit since 2006 and as its lead physician since 2013, overseeing Mr. Obama’s physicals. Dr. Jackson had told several people that he planned to retire from Washington after Mr. Obama left office. But Mr. Trump, whose previous personal physician made headlines with a series of unauthorized news interviews about his patient, asked Dr. Jackson to stay on. Mr. Trump, who goes to great lengths to hide details of his personal life, quickly came to trust Dr. Jackson, referring to him warmly as “Doc” around the White House. Democrats, moderate Republicans and mainline veterans groups have all feared that Dr. Shulkin’s departure could clear the way for a more aggressive push for government-subsidized private care at the department. “Every major veterans’ organization in this country vigorously opposes the privatization of the V.A.,” Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “I stand with them. Our job is to strengthen the V.A. in order to provide high-quality care to our veterans, not dismember it.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the rank of Dr. Ronny L. Jackson. He is a rear admiral, not an admiral.","WASHINGTON — After weeks of uncertainty atop the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Trump dismissed its secretary, David J.

He said he was not changing any other policy areas, including raising taxes or cutting spending. The president, who had been considering replacing Secretary Eric H. Holder Jr., is also expected to name another veteran to lead the department, which oversees more than 40 million people and $1 trillion in annual federal programs. But Mr. Trump, whose administration has faced criticism over staffing decisions, appears determined to make changes before they are necessary. In recent days, he has shown little inclination to change course when confronted by critics of his approach to mental illness, even though his own advisers say he understands the issue better than many others. His choice of Dr. Jackson, whom Republicans criticized last month for being too cozy with drug companies, came only hours after he named two new cabinet secretaries, Betsy DeVos of Michigan and Wilbur Ross of New York, to run the Education Department. Both men were chosen from lists of names submitted by Democrats who wanted them to be considered for the job. A day earlier, the Senate voted 52 to 47 against confirming Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee who has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault and harassment. And just before leaving for a speech in Ohio, Mr. Trump had hinted that he might consider nominating Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who has called the accusations unsubstantiated. The timing of Dr. Jackson’s selection, coming shortly after Mr. Trump met privately with several members of Congress and declared that he was making good on campaign promises to overhaul the nation’s entitlement system, raised questions about whether the president intended to follow through on those commitments. At least one person close to Mr. Trump expressed concern that the selections could backfire politically. “It seems like a bit of desperation to me,” said Representative Charlie Sykes, Democrat of Illinois, who was among several lawmakers who pressed Mr. Trump during their conversations to replace Ms. DeVos. “He’s trying to put together something big, but I don’t know if that will work.” As the government faces a continuing reckoning over how to pay for a sprawling array of programs, Mr. Trump’s choices signal a shift away from traditional Washington politics, where presidents often seek advice from lobbyists and corporate executives. Instead, Mr. Trump appears intent on using his executive authority to reshape the way the country spends money, and he has already made major cuts to agencies such as Medicare and Social Security. While the president has repeatedly said he wants to reduce spending, he has not always been clear about exactly what he intends to cut. Last week, he suggested eliminating all federal subsidies for low-income Americans and increasing tax rates on wealthy individuals. On Tuesday, he promised to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood clinics, saying they were part of a broader effort to curb abortion rights. Mr. Trump has vowed to protect American jobs and wages, but he has also said he would look into reducing regulations and easing trade barriers. For now, Mr. Trump appears focused on putting together a plan to save the military and rebuild America’s infrastructure. “I want to do everything we can to help our Military families,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning. “But most importantly, I want to keep our great Military strong!” He added: “We need a total & permanent re-up of WALL STREET for Border security and Dems must vote NO on Repealing Tax Reform. We cannot allow this horrible mess to continue!” Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a series of meetings with senior military leaders on Friday, according to three attendees of the event. Those talks will focus on ways to improve readiness and training of recruits, as well as ways to streamline procurement procedures to ensure that troops receive the best equipment. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has frequently boasted about building up the armed forces, telling supporters that he would increase troop numbers by 10 percent each year until he reached 100,000. Now, he is likely to use his powers of persuasion to promote policies that benefit his base, while avoiding fights with Democrats. “The military is very important to my agenda because it’s the backbone of our Country,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “And it’s the backbone of our economy. It’s very important.” Mr. Trump’s decision to nominate Dr. Jackson — a retired Army general who served in Iraq and Afghanistan — comes after months of speculation about his plans to fill a top Pentagon position. Several times since then, Mr. Trump has said that he would not make an announcement until he had made one for the State Department. But this week, Mr. Trump finally did so at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. In doing so, he showed himself willing to put aside personal animus and political considerations as he looks ahead to filling senior positions in the administration. The president-elect also signaled that he was open to making changes in the way the federal government does business if they were needed. He said he wanted to change how Congress spends money, saying that lawmakers should be forced to vote against spending increases when they don’t have enough votes to pass them. And he suggested that the Federal Reserve might need to raise interest rates more quickly than previously anticipated. “I am going to do everything I can to help you get things done, but we are living through some really tough economic times,” Mr. Trump said. “We have got to look at ways to lower taxes, and I will certainly consider lowering regulations. We have got to start looking at infrastructure, which is absolutely critical to us.” Mr. Trump’s selection of Dr. Jackson came hours before the Senate confirmed President Barack Obama’s choice, John Brennan, as the next C.I.A. director. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said he would wait to see what Mr. Trump did with the nomination. But he added: “It’s fair to say that there’s been a lot of talk about him being somebody that’s anti-Israel or something like that. That’s just not true.” The timing of Mr. Trump’s remarks on Tuesday could have significant implications on his ability to get legislation passed through Congress. If Mr. Trump chooses someone from outside the Beltway establishment, it could force Democrats to fight harder to block any bill that includes provisions they object to. At least two bills, including one by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, contain language that critics of Israel want included in a final agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians, according to people familiar with their negotiations. Some Republicans are already upset over those measures. They fear that the Palestinian Authority may use the new United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Gaza to try to undermine the talks and prevent a peace deal. A spokesman for Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the senator would not support such efforts. Mr. Trump also said he planned to meet privately with former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, whom he named as ambassador to South Korea, once he becomes president. Mr. Trump called Mr. Gates “a great guy” and praised his work ethic. “He’s smart and a good person,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s a hell of a guy.” Mr. Trump said he would consider naming another retired Marine general, James N. Mattis, as secretary of defense. But he said he would not name anyone else. His pick for the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, was chosen by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has clashed with Mr. Trump on several occasions. Mr. Trump said he would make the appointment, too. Mr. Trump said he would not name a cabinet member until he had decided whether he would run again for office. On Thursday, he was asked about his pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border, and said he would be open to discussing a trade deal with Mexico. “I think it’s going to happen,” he said. “I don’t know when it’s going to happen, but I think we’re going to do it.” He said that he would be open to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, though he added: “I don’t know why they didn’t negotiate it.” The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said that Mr. Trump would not comment on policy matters. But the president-elect has repeatedly hinted that he intends to take executive action on immigration, and he said on Monday that he would be considering expanding the number of H-1B visas available for workers in high-tech fields.",GPT-NEO,True,
15,"WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, resigned under pressure on Friday after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights and undermining President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp of a corrupt and entitled capital. Already in trouble with Mr. Trump for months of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care program, Mr. Price failed to defuse the president’s anger by offering regret and a partial reimbursement. His departure was the latest from an administration buffeted by turbulence at the top, and capped a week of setbacks for the president. “I’m not happy, O.K.?” Mr. Trump told reporters who asked about Mr. Price as the president prepared to leave for his New Jersey golf club for the weekend, barely an hour before the resignation was announced. “I can tell you, I’m not happy.” He called Mr. Price “a very good man” but added that the secretary’s offer to pay back the government for just part of the cost of the private flights “would be unacceptable.” Mr. Price ran afoul of one of the president’s most consequential campaign pledges. While some of Mr. Trump’s advisers privately make light of his vow to drain the swamp of Washington privilege, to many of his voters, it was a threshold promise. The firestorm over Mr. Price came as the president was already on the defensive with his base, as the incumbent mainstream Republican senator he backed in an Alabama primary race lost to an insurgent channeling Mr. Trump’s election movement. “It’s hard to see how a cabinet secretary can drain the swamp from 42,000 feet in the plush interior of a taxpayer-funded Gulfstream 4,” said Laura Ingraham, a conservative talk show host and Trump supporter who, like others, defied the president by backing Roy Moore, the insurgent Senate candidate who won in Alabama. Mr. Trump berated Mr. Price in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon for about two hours before heading out to meet with reporters, according to people informed about the meeting. All cabinet travel requests now must be cleared by the White House, they said. The White House’s announcement of Mr. Price’s departure was sparse, with none of the customary thanks for his service; it said simply that he had “offered his resignation earlier today and the president accepted.” In his resignation letter to Mr. Trump, Mr. Price said: “I have spent 40 years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first. I regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives. Success on these issues is more important than any one person. In order for you to move forward without further disruption, I am officially tendering my resignation.” Mr. Trump tapped Don J. Wright, a deputy assistant secretary for health and the director of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, to serve as acting secretary. Possible candidates for a successor include Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Price’s job was on the line since the first of a string of reports by Politico, on Sept. 19, about his extensive use of chartered aircraft. The president has fumed privately and publicly about Mr. Price’s actions. Hoping to assuage Mr. Trump, the secretary offered on Thursday to reimburse the government $51,887 — which he said represented the cost of his seat on the trips — of the at least $400,000 spent. But it was not enough to save his job. Mr. Price, a physician and a former Republican congressman from Georgia who had long opposed Mr. Obama’s Affordable Care Act, served as a point man on Mr. Trump’s drive to scrap the law. In July, Mr. Trump said he would fire Mr. Price if he did not get the votes for the legislation. “He better get them,” Mr. Trump told an audience with Mr. Price at his side. “Otherwise, I’ll say, ‘Tom, you’re fired.’” He said it in a jocular fashion, and his audience took it as a jest, but in fact the president has been privately simmering about Mr. Price over the unsuccessful efforts to pass health care legislation in the Senate. While a bill passed the House, the latest effort collapsed this week when enough Senate Republicans defected to deprive Mr. Trump of a majority. Mr. Price had been under fire from the start. During his confirmation hearing in January, Senate Democrats pressed him on the more than $100,000 in pharmaceutical and medical stocks he owned. Democrats said that Mr. Price had understated the value of his 400,613 shares in an Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics. He defended himself, saying, “Everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent.” In just eight months since taking office, Mr. Trump has fired or lost a chief of staff, a chief strategist, a national security adviser, a press secretary, two communications directors, a deputy chief of staff, a deputy national security adviser, the F.B.I. director and numerous other aides and advisers. Mr. Price may not be the only senior official to face anger over travel bills. In recent days, a slew of reports about the fast-lane habits of the cabinet have resulted in a mounting public relations headache for the Trump administration, which is stocked by billionaires accustomed to using private jets. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, used a chartered airplane for several flights, including a $12,000 trip to deliver a speech celebrating a new professional hockey team in Las Vegas. Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has spent more than $58,000 on chartered and military flights, and David Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary, took his wife on a 10-day trip to Europe that mixed business meetings and sightseeing, according to The Washington Post. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked about using a $25,000-an-hour military plane for his European honeymoon and later used a government jet to fly to Fort Knox in Kentucky in August, a trip that offered him a clear view of a solar eclipse, although he later disclaimed any interest. Other cabinet members issued statements explaining their travel practices. The Small Business Administration said its chief, Linda McMahon, had used private air services and that “on the rare occasion” she had, she “covered the entire cost out of her own pocket.” Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, travels on personally owned aircraft “at zero cost to U.S. taxpayers” because she “neither seeks, nor accepts, any reimbursement,” the department said. The sensitivity about the situation within the cabinet was clear on Friday when Mr. Zinke delivered an energy policy address to the Heritage Foundation. He opened his speech by lashing out at what he called “a little B.S.” on chartered flights. “I fly coach,” he said, adding that he uses chartered or military flights only when necessary. “Every time I travel, I submit the travel plans to the ethics department,” he added. “I will always be honest and up front about my travel.” Current and former West Wing officials said oversight of Mr. Trump’s cabinet was so lax in the past that Stephen K. Bannon, then the president’s chief strategist, requested meetings once every 60 days to review each member’s agenda and travel itinerary. The secretaries did not flag the questionable flights, the officials said. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who has tried to impose a military discipline on a chaotic West Wing with mixed success, has ordered the president’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, to revamp the review process for flights and set limits on prices that cabinet members can pay for transportation, according to two people briefed on the plans. At a recent meeting with legislative affairs aides for cabinet agencies, Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, warned that they should be prepared for additional reports on cabinet secretaries’ expenses, according to a person who attended. Mr. Short said that agencies should assume everything will be made public eventually — and urged the aides to come clean with the president’s staff first. Additionally, Rick Dearborn, a deputy White House chief of staff tasked with overseeing the cabinet, has been in the president’s cross hairs, according to an aide familiar with the situation. Mr. Dearborn accompanied Mr. Trump on his visit to Alabama last week to support Senator Luther Strange, who lost to Mr. Moore in the state’s Republican primary. On the flight back to Washington, the president lashed out at Mr. Dearborn and White House political director Bill Stepien because he was left supporting a candidate who seemed likely to lose, said the aide who was not authorized to be named. Two people on the plane insisted the president never chastised his aides. Another adviser said Mr. Dearborn and Mr. Stepien had both cautioned against the trip, but caught Mr. Trump’s wrath once it went badly. Critics were unmollified by Mr. Price’s departure. “While his resignation ends his time in the government, it does not end the private jet scandal that others in the Trump administration, including Mnuchin, Pruitt and Zinke, find themselves in,” Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a progressive watchdog group, said in a statement. “This administration,” he added, “seems to believe that the government and the taxpayers serve them rather than the other way around.” Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said the episode demonstrated a lack of judgment in the administration. “President Trump talked a big game about draining the swamp, yet he continues to surround himself with staff and administration officials who behave as though a separate set of rules apply to them,” he said. “That must end.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the events leading up to Secretary Price’s resignation. It was President Trump, not former President Barack Obama, who threatened to fire Mr. Price.","WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, resigned under pressure on Friday after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights and undermining President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp of a corrupt and entitled capital.

Already in trouble with Mr. Trump for months of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care program, Mr. Price failed to defuse the president’s anger by offering regret and a partial reimbursement. of his expenses as he traveled around the country promoting Republican policies. Instead, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Price had “been very wrong” about his own conduct and accused him of having “totally destroyed” any chance of passing legislation overhauling insurance markets. The White House announced Mr. Price’s departure hours later without naming an interim replacement or saying when it would be filled permanently. In a statement, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Price, 62, who was confirmed last February despite some Democrats raising questions about his ethics during confirmation hearings because of stock trades made while serving as a member of Congress from Georgia. But the president added: “The Department of Health and Human Services is critical to keeping Americans safe and protecting their well-being.” He called Dr. Price “a valued adviser and friend,” adding, “His work on opioid abuse prevention has been particularly profound, helping people across this nation get into treatment and recover.” A few minutes earlier, Mr. Price issued a contrite letter to colleagues announcing his decision to step down. “I love my job and I am honored to serve in this administration,” wrote Mr. Price, who served briefly as a surgeon general before being promoted to lead H.H.S., which includes the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “But recently, articles have appeared that are distracting from our important mission at the agency.” His letter did not mention the scandal involving his use of private jets instead of commercial planes to visit medical centers and attend conferences. Nor did it address other complaints raised by lawmakers and watchdog groups about Mr. Price’s frequent trips abroad and how they were paid for. As part of its investigation, Politico reported Thursday night that the department spent more than $1 million flying Mr. Price alone since May 23. That included two international trips costing nearly half a million dollars each, one of them to Africa where Mr. Price visited Ebola patients. While the price tag may seem large compared with what most federal employees spend on airfare, it pales next to the amount spent on Air Force One, the presidential plane, which costs roughly $180,000 per hour to fly. And the total does not include thousands of additional taxpayer dollars spent shuttling Mr. Price between Washington and Atlanta so he could catch his flight home every weekend. Those costs came out of the same budget used to pay for many public health programs, including those focused on fighting addiction. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that he wanted Mr. Price gone but stopped short of demanding his ouster. By Friday afternoon, however, Mr. Trump seemed eager to move past the controversy surrounding Mr. Price, whom he appointed even though he knew little about him beyond his reputation as a conservative doctor. “We will begin searching for a new candidate forthwith,” Mr. Trump told reporters outside the Oval Office shortly before noon. “Obviously we want someone that loves the American people and wants to give back to America great health care.” It remained unclear whether Mr. Trump would appoint another cabinet official to temporarily fill Mr. Price’s position until a permanent successor can be found. If not, Mr. Trump might name a political appointee like Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, whose nomination stalled amid opposition from liberal senators concerned about her ties to Vice President Mike Pence and her role in Indiana’s expansion of Medicaid coverage. Ms. Verma, if nominated again, faces similar scrutiny from Democratic senators over her record running the state’s Medicaid system. Her critics say she cut benefits and imposed rules requiring recipients to seek prior approval for certain prescription drugs. She also drew criticism for her handling of a crisis related to the spread of H.I.V. among drug users injecting themselves illegally with fentanyl, heroin laced with fentanyl or carfentanil — all synthetic narcotics linked to hundreds of deaths. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking forward to finding a replacement who shares Mr. Price’s views on repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a less expensive alternative. They believe Mr. Price’s resignation will help clear the way for a vote on such proposals after months of setbacks and delays caused by internal divisions within the party. Still, there is reason for concern. Many Republicans remain skeptical about the GOP health care plan that was unveiled last month in Congress as an effort to replace President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. And the White House has not yet put forth its own detailed proposal, leaving many lawmakers unsure what they should support next. The uncertainty over whether Republicans can pass their legislation before the August recess may have contributed to Mr. Trump’s decision to fire his first secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, according to several people close to him. “I think he realized this isn’t going anywhere,” said one person briefed on the president’s thinking. On Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted: “The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on healthcare.” He added later: “Tom Price is a very good man & prominent Republican leader. He is also a highly respected medical expert. Same w/ Jim Mattis, General Kelly etc…..” A spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan confirmed late Thursday night that Mr. Price had submitted his letter of resignation at 8 p.m., but she declined further comment until the speaker received more details from the administration. In addition to being under pressure because of his stock trades while serving as HHS chief, Mr. Price faced opposition among some conservatives because he did not want to disrupt insurance markets created through the Affordable Care Act. Conservative groups like Heritage Action and FreedomWorks criticized Mr. Price’s efforts to stabilize those markets without undermining them entirely. But now, with Mr. Price gone, Mr. Trump could nominate someone willing to take a harder line against the law known as Obamacare. One name mentioned frequently is Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She would be able to use her agency to make changes to regulations governing the health care system that would circumvent congressional approval. Another possibility is Alex Azar II, a former executive vice president at Eli Lilly and Company whose wife, Susan DeVore, led the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation during the Obama years. Both Ms. Verma and Mr. Azar were considered possible replacements when Mr. Price came into office. While Mr. Price was well liked personally, he clashed repeatedly with Mr. Trump, especially over how best to move ahead on health policy. As recently as Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Mr. Price, saying in a Twitter post that “ObamaCare premiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare!” The president then turned his attention to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, asking why he hadn’t passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. It wasn’t immediately clear if Mr. Trump knew of Mr. Price’s plans to step down. After Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as FBI director earlier this year, he learned only afterward that Mr. Comey planned to announce publicly that he was stepping aside. By contrast, Mr. Price told colleagues privately that he intended to leave soon, giving them time to prepare for a leadership change. Mr. Price’s departure leaves two vacant Cabinet positions remaining: interior secretary and agriculture secretary. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced her retirement just hours ago; Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is expected to stay in place for six weeks longer than originally scheduled. Several other cabinet secretaries have left since January, including Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and Veterans Affairs Secretary David J. Shulkin. At least three others have been nominated to fill openings, though none has been formally approved. Some Democrats saw Mr. Price’s departure as another sign of chaos inside the West Wing.",LLaMa2,True,
16,"WASHINGTON — In a speech on Friday to world and financial leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump mixed facts, falsehoods and claims that could use context. Below are some statements from the speech about the economy and Mr. Trump’s place in history. The economy has added almost 2.4 million jobs in the 14 months since Mr. Trump was elected in November 2016 — but it is worth noting that this number includes the last three months of Barack Obama’s presidency. Also, as a point of comparison, the economy added 2.8 million jobs in the 14 months before Mr. Trump’s election. During the first 11 full months of Mr. Trump’s presidency, 1.8 million jobs were added. And in the 11 months before he was inaugurated, 2.1 million jobs were added. It is also debatable whether Mr. Trump, or any first-year president, can take full credit for a strong economy (or be censured, were it to happen, for weak economic performance). As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained: “If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no. If you think that what really matters is the mood in the executive suite, then just maybe.” The $1.5 trillion tax cut enacted in December does not amount to the largest in history, nor is Mr. Trump the first president to pass tax cuts since President Ronald Reagan. President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W. Bush enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under Mr. Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and he later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Mr. Reagan’s 1981 tax cut, Mr. Obama’s stimulus package and extensions of Mr. Bush’s tax cuts would all place ahead of Mr. Trump’s tax cut as a share of the economy and in inflation-adjusted dollars. Several presidents have owned, operated or worked in the field of business. Most immediately, George Bush and George W. Bush both owned several oil companies based out of Texas. The latter was also part of an ownership group that purchased the Texas Rangers baseball team. Jimmy Carter owned a peanut farm and some other real estate in Georgia. Herbert Hoover became wealthy after founding a mining engineer consultancy. Warren Harding was the owner and publisher of a newspaper. Calvin Coolidge worked for a bank. Teddy Roosevelt owned and operated a ranch in the Dakotas Territory. Looking further back, George Washington, James Madison and James Monroe all owned plantations. Mr. Trump is right that the unemployment rates for women and minorities are at or near historic lows. But it’s worth noting that these rates had been steadily declining for years by the time he took office. For black Americans, the unemployment rate of 6.8 percent in December was the lowest ever recorded, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It had already decreased to 7.8 percent in January 2017 from over 15 percent in 2010. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and it remained at that level in December. The Latino unemployment rate declined to 4.9 percent in December from 5.9 percent in January 2017, the second lowest — not the lowest, as Mr. Trump said — on record. It reached 4.8 percent in June, October and November 2017, as well as in October 2006 under George W. Bush. The 4.0 percent unemployment rate for women in December is among the lowest in 17 years, as Mr. Trump said. It was lower in October at 3.9 percent, down from 4.8 percent in January 2017. Mr. Trump is most likely referring to the rise in the Wilshire 5000 Index, a widely used metric. The index grew to 29,431.74 on Wednesday, from 22,165.78 points on Election Day 2016, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a gain of more than 7,200 points. A single point on the index represents $1.15 billion, so the market has added $8.3 trillion since Mr. Trump’s election. But these gains in wealth have disproportionally benefited Americans by income bracket. Roughly half of Americans do not own stock directly or in retirement accounts and mutual funds, and the richest 10 percent of households controlled 84 percent of the total value of stocks, a recent study by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research estimated. Buoyed by stock market growth, net household wealth increased to $96.9 trillion in the third quarter of 2017 from $91.7 trillion in the last quarter of 2016, according to the latest data available from the Federal Reserve. Pentagon officials have recently declared the defeat of the physical “caliphate” and said the Islamic State has lost nearly all of its territory in Iraq and Syria. At its peak in January 2015, the jihadist group controlled 35,000 square miles of territory in the Middle East. By the time Mr. Trump took office in January 2017, their holdings had shrunk to about 23,000 square miles. It further dwindled to  2,500 square miles in January 2018, according to IHS Markit, a research firm that has tracked territory held by the Islamic State. So while fighting has certainly escalated under Mr. Trump, the Islamic State had begun losing territory under Mr. Obama, and experts have cited this trend and the efforts of local troops when analyzing whom to credit for these gains. “It’s a fight for who’s going to give the most,” Mr. Trump said. “It started at $1,000, and now we have them up to $3,000.” More than 260 companies have announced employee bonuses, raises or investments since the tax bill was passed in December, according to an anecdotal list compiled by Americans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates lower taxes. The group’s president, Grover Norquist, worked with the White House to develop the legislation. Many have said they will give one-time employee bonuses of $1,000 to $2,000. According to the list, only one, a private insurance company, announced $3,000 bonuses for 700 employees in a news release on Dec. 21, the day before Mr. Trump signed the tax bill. It’s worth noting that most of these businesses are financial institutions and, as my colleague Jim Tankersley has reported, “The payouts to workers reflect a small slice of the windfall that banks large and small are in line to receive.”","WASHINGTON — In a speech on Friday to world and financial leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump mixed facts, falsehoods and claims that could use context.

17,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Soon, American Embassy employees in Kabul will no longer need to take a Chinook helicopter ride to cross the street to a military base less than 100 yards outside the present Green Zone security district. Instead, the boundaries of the Green Zone will be redrawn to include that base, known as the Kabul City Compound, formerly the headquarters for American Special Operations forces in the capital. The zone is separated from the rest of the city by a network of police, military and private security checkpoints. The expansion is part of a huge public works project that over the next two years will reshape the center of this city of five million to bring nearly all Western embassies, major government ministries, and NATO and American military headquarters within the protected area. After 16 years of American presence in Kabul, it is a stark acknowledgment that even the city’s central districts have become too difficult to defend from Taliban bombings. But the capital project is also clearly taking place to protect another long-term American investment: Along with an increase in troops to a reported 15,000, from around 11,000 at the moment, the Trump administration’s new strategy for Afghanistan is likely to keep the military in place well into the 2020s, even by the most conservative estimates. No one wants to say when any final pullout will take place, because the emphasis now is on a conditions-based withdrawal — presumably meaning after the Afghan government can handle the war alone. But President Trump has kept secret the details of those conditions, and how they are defined. “Until he says what the conditions are, all that means is we’ll be there as long as we want, for whatever reason we want,” said Barnett Rubin, a longtime Afghanistan expert who advised the Obama administration. “And they don’t have to lie to do that, because the conditions will never be good enough to say we’re absolutely not needed.” In practical terms, it means that the American military mission will continue for many more years, despite its unpopularity with the American public. Many military strategists, in America and Afghanistan, have already penciled in plans well into the ’20s, and certainly past any Trump re-election campaign. At the NATO summit meeting in Warsaw last year, the allies, including the United States, agreed to fund the development of the Afghan security forces until the end of what was termed “the transition decade,” meaning from 2014, when Afghan forces began to take charge of their own security, until 2024. “I would guess the U.S. has to plan on being inside Afghanistan for a decade or more in order for there to be any type of resolution,” said Bill Roggio, editor of Long War Journal. “It’s definitely past his first term in office, no two ways about it.” The Green Zone expansion is aimed at making it possible for America and its NATO allies to remain in the capital without facing the risks that have in the past year made Kabul the most dangerous place in Afghanistan, with more people killed there than anywhere else in the country — mostly from suicide bombers. Kabul’s security area had long been a Green Zone-lite compared with its fortresslike predecessor in Baghdad, where there are massive blast walls and a total separation from the general population, enforced by biometric entry passes. In Kabul, thousands of Afghans still commute to jobs and even schools inside the zone, with only light searches for most of them, mindful of the resentment stirred by the Soviets’ heavily militarized central zone during their Afghan occupation. And the Green Zone in Baghdad has, its critics maintain, created an out-of-touch ruling class and Western community, and provided a magnet for protests while just moving enormous bombings elsewhere, further stoking popular discontent with leaders and foreigners. The Kabul Green Zone expansion, which will significantly restrict access, was prompted, according to both Afghan and American military officials, by a huge suicide bomb planted in a sewage truck that exploded at a gate of the current Green Zone on May 31, destroying most of the German Embassy and killing more than 150 people. The loss of life could have been far worse, but Germany had evacuated its embassy a week before the bombing, apparently tipped off by intelligence sources. The military recently appointed an American brigadier general to take charge of greatly expanding and fortifying the Green Zone. In the first stage of the project, expected to take from six months to a year, an expanded Green Zone will be created — covering about 1.86 square miles, up from 0.71 square miles — closing off streets within it to all but official traffic. Because that will also cut two major arteries through the city, in an area where traffic congestion is already rage-inducing for Afghan drivers, the plans call for building a ring road on the northern side of the Wazir Akbar Khan hill to carry traffic around the new Green Zone. In a final stage, a still bigger Blue Zone will be established, encompassing most of the city center, where severe restrictions on movement — especially by trucks — will be put in place. Already, height restriction barriers have been built over roads throughout Kabul to block trucks. Eventually, all trucks seeking to enter Kabul will be routed through a single portal, where they will be X-rayed and searched. The process of turning Kabul into a fortress started before Mr. Trump took office, of course — security measures were tightened and an obtrusive network of blast walls was established in some places years before President Barack Obama left office. Some of the plans for long-term American assistance in Afghanistan were already in place, too, and have been enhanced. An ambitious $6.5 billion program to build a serious Afghan Air Force is scheduled to take until 2023. In Brussels last October, the United States and other donor nations agreed to continue $15 billion in development funding for the country through 2020. Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has suggested that American forces would remain in Afghanistan until victory. But even his own generals have conceded that a complete military victory in Afghanistan is not possible. The only solution most see is to persuade the Taliban to sit down to peace talks — something they have refused to do as long as American soldiers remain in the country. And with the insurgents gaining ground steadily in the past two years, the Taliban have even less incentive to negotiate. “It seems America is not yet ready to end the longest war in its history,” said the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, after Mr. Trump announced his new policy. “As Trump stated, ‘Americans are weary of the long war in Afghanistan.’ We shall cast further worry into them and force American officials to accept realities.” The Afghan ambassador to Washington, Hamdullah Mohib, said that talking about how much longer Americans may stay in Afghanistan obscures how different the years to come will be from the first 16 years. “I think a lot of the discussions when people talk about American presence in Afghanistan, the memory comes of when they were actively involved in combat and bodies were coming back to the United States. That is no longer the case,” Mr. Mohib said. “The majority of those soldiers are helping us improve our logistics, organizational capabilities, putting systems in place. While yes, there is an element of counterterrorism operations, it’s largely airstrikes supporting the Afghan special forces.” Despite the long-term scenario most military planners have embraced, there are still some dates that could disrupt the calendar. Next year, the country will hold elections for a new Parliament — three years late — but there are concerns that preparations for the elections will not be completed in time. An even greater concern is the following year, 2019, when presidential elections are due. The last presidential election, in 2014, was a fiasco, and amid accusations of fraud and vote-rigging, the outcome ended up in an American-negotiated deal to form a shaky coalition government. The United States may be willing to look past another tainted election, though the last one nearly devolved into factional conflict. Europe and the NATO allies, however, may be another matter; they have repeatedly insisted on clean and credible elections as a condition for continued support. “This may be our last golden opportunity,” said Haroun Mir, an Afghan political analyst. “If we cannot solve our problems by 2019, if we move to an ethnic conflict, this may spread to the Afghan security forces, and that would undermine the entire U.S. effort in Afghanistan.” He doubts the United States would stay if that happened. For now, though, the Americans and their allies seem ready to dig in. The Taliban have been fond of quoting an old Afghan saying: “You have the watches, we have the time.” After Mr. Trump announced his new strategy, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, used a televised speech to turn that expression on its head: “The Taliban should go buy a watch,” he said, because time was now on the government’s side.","KABUL, Afghanistan — Soon, American Embassy employees in Kabul will no longer need to take a Chinook helicopter ride to cross the street to a military base less than 100 yards outside the present Green Zone security district.

The move is part of an effort by President Obama’s administration to reduce its footprint across Afghanistan while still maintaining some presence there after most troops are gone this year. But it also reflects how much has changed since the United States invaded Afghanistan nearly 13 years ago: Even if the Taliban have not been defeated, they do not control any major city anymore; even though violence remains high, the country does not seem headed toward civil war again; and even though the government of President Ashraf Ghani is weak, he is trying to make peace with his enemies rather than fight them. “We don’t want our diplomats living behind walls,” said James Dobbins, a former senior State Department official involved in negotiating the deal between Mr. Ghani and Gen. John F. Campbell, then commander of international forces in Afghanistan. “The idea was to get out of the old compounds.” In addition to reducing troop levels from more than 9,800 today to zero by next December, the Pentagon plans to shutter several bases around the country before the end of September. A few hundred Marines will remain in Helmand Province until October but will leave their main base there soon. They may return later to help train local police units, officials say. At least one other Marine base in southern Afghanistan will close soon, too. And the Army Corps of Engineers will pull back all its personnel working on construction projects throughout the country except those helping build up the Afghan National Security Forces. All told, the number of foreign soldiers left in Afghanistan will fall below 10,000 when the last American soldier leaves Bagram Air Base near Kabul early next month. That is down sharply from the peak force of 140,000 deployed here during the height of combat operations against insurgents. Still, the United States will retain a small counterterrorism team inside the Interior Ministry building downtown that helps coordinate intelligence-gathering efforts among various agencies and provides advice to Afghan commandos fighting Islamist militants. It will continue training Afghan pilots and air controllers so they can fly fighter jets and transport planes bought from the West. And it will keep running drone surveillance flights over Pakistan and elsewhere. Most important, the C.I.A.’s paramilitary teams operating undercover in Afghan villages and cities will stay put. Those specialists are crucial because the Taliban, despite being pushed into remote areas where they cannot easily attack urban centers like Kabul, have shown little sign of losing momentum. Last week, the group killed two members of Parliament in eastern Paktia province, just days after killing another lawmaker in neighboring Logar province. Both attacks were claimed by the Taliban. The latest killings come amid increasing reports that the Taliban are regrouping in northern provinces bordering Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, raising fears that they could stage a comeback similar to what happened in Iraq following the withdrawal of Western forces there. To prevent such a scenario, the Obama administration wants to ensure that enough American advisory teams remain embedded within the Afghan army and police to provide guidance and support to officers on the ground. There are currently roughly 7,600 American service members providing assistance to the Afghan armed forces through Operation Resolute Support, which began late last summer. While many of these troops are stationed at large bases outside the country’s big cities, others live alongside Afghans in garrison towns and rural districts. Some embed themselves directly with individual battalion commands. Officials expect that the total number of coalition forces remaining in Afghanistan will drop to fewer than 10,000 once the final contingent departs Bagram, including the 1,000 American troops already scheduled to go home by the end of August. Of course, the numbers alone tell only half the story. For example, the number of British troops in Afghanistan dropped to five earlier this year, but Britain continues to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to fundamentally transform the Afghan military. As part of that effort, the British government recently announced that it would send additional instructors to teach tactics to Afghan Special Operations Commandos — elite troops trained for direct action missions. This type of mission is exactly what the United States hopes to avoid as it tries to wind down involvement in Afghanistan without leaving it vulnerable to extremist takeover. So far, however, the Taliban appear undeterred. On Thursday, the movement released a video showing a group of fighters dressed like American commandos taking part in an exercise with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at their side. The footage was shot from above; it showed the men training on open fields near Kunduz Province. It also included interviews with some of them about how they had been taught by foreigners. “The Americans are teaching us all kinds of things,” one said. Another added: “They’re telling you which way to go when you attack.” In recent years, there have been reports of such activities across northern Afghanistan. But this time around, the videos were filmed not only during the day but also after dark, suggesting that the militants may be getting more sophisticated in using night vision goggles or other equipment supplied by Western nations. Last year, the Pentagon acknowledged that it had provided the insurgents with “some” night vision devices. And the United Nations has reported that the Taliban now possess helicopters, drones and surveillance aircraft. While the exact source of these weapons remains unclear, evidence suggests that many come from Pakistan, where Islamabad maintains close ties with the Taliban leadership. For its part, Washington continues to deny providing any military assistance directly to the Taliban. But the new videos suggest that even if the United States does not intend to arm the enemy, it might still unwittingly end up arming its enemies indirectly through allies who do so willingly. That could further complicate President Obama’s efforts to withdraw thousands of American forces from Afghanistan over the next two years while ensuring that the country does not fall back into chaos. As he prepares to announce his decision on Friday regarding troop levels beyond 2016, Mr. Obama faces another challenge: How can he ensure that Afghans themselves remain committed to fighting terrorism? Since the start of last month, the number of attacks carried out against civilians has increased significantly compared with previous months, according to data collected by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. There have already been several major assaults in Kabul alone since January, including suicide bombings outside a bank and a police station. These incidents have killed hundreds of people, mostly civilians, and wounded scores more. Some analysts say that the Taliban’s apparent ability to acquire increasingly advanced weaponry points toward greater cooperation between the Pakistani intelligence services and the Taliban. One example came earlier this week, when the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing three members of the security detail assigned to Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, president of Afghanistan. Two bodyguards were among those killed. According to the Associated Press news agency, the attack took place just before dawn, when the guards were returning home from work. Their bodies were found lying along a roadside littered with bullet casings. The Taliban often use similar methods to carry out assassinations in Afghan cities. They typically target high-profile individuals and try to kill them in broad daylight, hoping to cause maximum carnage. Such attacks usually involve multiple gunmen armed with pistols, machine guns and explosives. In addition to the latest round of violence, the Taliban have continued to stage large-scale offensives throughout the winter. Most recently, the militant group launched a coordinated assault against Afghan Security Forces in Helmand province, the birthplace of the Taliban. More than half of the nation’s opium poppy crop comes from the region, making it rich in resources that help fund the insurgency. During the five days of clashes, the Taliban managed to seize control of parts of Lashkar Gah district, the provincial capital. Although the battle ended on Monday, the city remained under threat because of persistent sniping and mortar fire. Even though the Afghan Army eventually regained full control of the area, the episode raised questions about whether the army was ready to fight without international support. Afterward, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., warned that the conflict was likely to intensify.",LLaMa2,True,
18,"CHICAGO — Racism has contributed to a long pattern of institutional failures by the Chicago Police Department in which officers have mistreated people, operated without sufficient oversight, and lost the trust of residents, a task force appointed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel has found. The report, issued on Wednesday, was blistering, blunt and backed up by devastating statistics. Coincidentally, it was released as city leaders were installing a new, permanent superintendent for the Chicago Police Department. “C.P.D.’s own data gives validity to the widely held belief the police have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color,” the task force wrote. “Stopped without justification, verbally and physically abused, and in some instances arrested, and then detained without counsel — that is what we heard about over and over again.” The report reinforces complaints made for decades by African-American residents who have said they were unfairly singled out by officers without justification on a regular basis, then ignored when they raised complaints. It comes at a pivotal moment for the nation’s second-largest municipal police force, which is being criticized by residents and is under scrutiny from the Justice Department. And, coming from Mr. Emanuel’s own appointees, the findings intensify pressure on him and other Chicago leaders to make substantive, swift changes. The report makes more than 100 specific recommendations for change, and task force members called on the mayor and the City Council to take action. After formally receiving the report, Mr. Emanuel had no immediate public reaction. The task force amassed data that shows the extent to which African-Americans appear to have been disproportionately focused on by the police. In a city where whites, blacks and Hispanics each make up about one-third of the population, 74 percent of the 404 people shot by the Chicago police between 2008 and 2015 were black, the report said. Black people were the subjects in 72 percent of the thousands of investigative street stops that did not lead to arrests during the summer of 2014. Three out of every four people on whom Chicago police officers tried to use Taser guns between 2012 and 2015 were black. And black drivers made up 46 percent of police traffic stops in 2013. “The community’s lack of trust in C.P.D. is justified,” according to the report, a draft summary of which was first reported in The Chicago Tribune on Tuesday afternoon. “There is substantial evidence that people of color — particularly African-Americans — have had disproportionately negative experiences with the police over an extended period of time.” The stinging findings come at a particularly volatile time here, as violent crimes have increased this year and as police morale is reported to have sunk. Murders are up 62 percent this year compared with a year ago, Chicago police statistics show, and shootings have increased by 78 percent. Public pressure has remained intense. Just this week, after an officer fatally shot a black 16-year-old who the police said was armed, protesters took to the streets. The task force was given its assignment late last year, after the release of a graphic dashcam video showing a white Chicago police officer, Jason Van Dyke, fatally shooting a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, along a Chicago street. Widespread protests followed, and Mr. Emanuel fired the city’s police superintendent. He was officially replaced on Wednesday by the mayor’s choice, Eddie Johnson, a longtime Chicago officer who is black, grew up in a public housing project, and lives on the city’s South Side. In picking Mr. Johnson, Mr. Emanuel sidestepped a city requirement that he select a superintendent from finalists chosen by a police board, and the City Council unanimously approved the choice on Wednesday. The task force members were racially diverse, with professional backgrounds in social work, law and government. Lori Lightfoot, the president of the Chicago Police Board, an oversight group, was chairwoman, and the panel was advised by Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, who spent part of his childhood in Chicago. “What we heard from people all across the city is they felt like they didn’t even have a claim to the geography in front of their house, on their street, or in their neighborhoods,” Ms. Lightfoot said, as she presented the report at a downtown library. She acknowledged high rates of violence in some of those communities, but said that did not excuse abuses of power by the police, and that officers must be trained to fight crime while also respecting residents’ rights. The panel described the city’s delays in releasing the Laquan McDonald video and officials’ false descriptions of what had happened in the days immediately after that shooting as a “tipping point” for long-simmering anger. But “the linkage between racism and C.P.D.” had not bubbled up only after the McDonald video was made public, it said. Rather, Mr. McDonald’s death gave voice to years of unfair treatment, distrust within minority communities, and to “the deaths of numerous men and women of color whose lives came to an end solely because of an encounter with C.P.D.,” the report said. “The task force heard over and over again from a range of voices, particularly from African-Americans, that some C.P.D. officers are racist, have no respect for the lives and experiences of people of color and approach every encounter with people of color as if the person, regardless of age, gender or circumstance, is a criminal,” the report said, adding later, “These encounters leave an indelible mark.” “Even if there was no arrest,” it said, “there is a lasting, negative effect.” The report also condemned aspects of the city’s contracts with police unions, calling for changes to clauses that they said “make it easy for officers to lie in official reports,” ban anonymous citizen complaints and prevent the department from rewarding officers who turn in rule-breaking colleagues. The contracts, the task force concluded, “have essentially turned the code of silence into official policy.” The president of the union that represents rank-and-file officers did not immediately respond to interview requests. The report calls for dissolving the Independent Police Review Authority, which is charged with overseeing the most serious claims of police misconduct. The task force concluded that the authority has failed to investigate a large segment of its cases, rarely carries out meaningful discipline, and is perceived as favoring the police. It recommended that it be replaced with a “fully transparent and accountable civilian police investigative agency.” The report also calls for an expansion of the city’s body cam program; a unit assigned to handle issues around mental health crises; and a new deputy chief at the department in charge of diversity and inclusion. It also recommended putting in place a citywide reconciliation process in which the superintendent would publicly acknowledge the department’s history of racial disparity and discrimination and make a public commitment to change. The recommendations and the report drew praise for their candor, but some here remained doubtful about whether it would really bring widespread change. “The strong diagnoses must be followed by action — by the mayor, the City Council and the Police Department,” said Karen Sheley, police practices director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. “Corrective measures — those outlined by the task force and others — must be fashioned in a way that they cannot be reversed.” Charlene A. Carruthers, national director of Black Youth Project 100, a Chicago-based activist organization, said that she had not yet reviewed the report, but that she considered the task force “yet another example of the mayor’s office and those in power in the city of Chicago making decisions on behalf of the community.” Ms. Carruthers said increased civilian oversight and changes to police union contracts — two task force recommendations — were urgently needed. But, she added, “I do not have confidence that the task force or the mayor’s office will take bold enough steps.” On Wednesday, before the report was released, Mr. Emanuel said that his “general attitude” was to be “open to look at everything they say.” He met with members of his task force late in the day, but did not comment on the report afterward. Earlier in the day, Mr. Emanuel had said he wanted to work through the issues. “I don’t really think you need a task force to know that we have racism in America, we have racism in Illinois, or that there’s racism that exists in the city of Chicago and obviously could be in our department,” he said. He added: “The question is: What are we going to do to confront it and make the changes in not only personnel but in policies to reflect, I think, the values that make up the diversity of our city?”","CHICAGO — Racism has contributed to a long pattern of institutional failures by the Chicago Police Department in which officers have mistreated people, operated without sufficient oversight, and lost the trust of residents, a task force appointed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel has found.

The panel also said that the city should stop using so many cops for traffic stops, citing studies showing they were ineffective at reducing crime, while noting that such encounters disproportionately affect blacks. “The Chicago Police Department is not broken,” Mr. Emanuel declared at an afternoon news conference in City Hall. But he acknowledged that it had failed for decades to meet community needs. He pledged that his administration would work with Congress, state lawmakers and other officials to enact reforms and that he would submit legislation this month. Mr. Emanuel did not say what those changes might be. The mayor has been under intense pressure since last year’s release of video footage from dashboard cameras, body cams and surveillance videos showing excessive use of force against suspects. In January, after several days of protests over two fatal shootings involving unarmed young men, the president, Barack Obama, called Mr. Emanuel to urge him to take action, according to aides familiar with the conversation. On Tuesday, after the Justice Department announced that federal investigators had opened an inquiry into whether police engaged in unconstitutional practices, President Trump tweeted: “Chicago just agreed to spend nearly a billion dollars upgrading their very expensive equipment.” A few hours later, a group of protesters gathered outside City Hall. They chanted and held signs reading, “Racism kills” and “No justice no peace no racist policing,” as they marched toward Michigan Avenue. “It is a shame,” said Anthony Williams, 27, who lives near where Laquan McDonald died in October. “We need change. We’ve got to get rid of all these bad cops. It has to happen now. This can’t wait any longer.” In its final report, the Task Force to Review CPD Practices and Policies made a total of 46 recommendations, including the creation of a new civilian review authority and an independent inspector general office. It recommended changes that could include new rules governing when the public may record law enforcement actions; more training on deescalation techniques; and a ban on chokeholds, among others. In addition, the task force suggested a moratorium on hiring until the mayor could develop more rigorous screening procedures, and recommended that police commanders have greater latitude in assigning detectives, sergeants, lieutenants, captains and superintendents, rather than having them assigned based on seniority. The recommendations came in response to the killing last November of Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones, both teenagers shot dead during separate incidents with armed police responding to calls about mental health crises in predominantly Black neighborhoods in far northern Illinois suburbs of Rockford and Joliet. Both killings led to demonstrations in downtown Chicago and drew national attention. In the case of Ms. Jones, her family filed suit on Monday seeking damages and calling on Mr. Emanuel and City Council members to fire a sergeant, who is accused of lying about how she handled the situation. On Wednesday, Ms. Jones’s mother, Cleo Collins, joined by Mr. LeGrier’s father, Jonathan Watkins, and others, spoke out about their experiences in dealing with officers. They described being treated like criminals. They told stories of police using racial epithets and threatening violence. And they recounted how they felt powerless, unable to protect themselves from officers. Ms. Jones’s brother, Jonathan LeGrier, 19, said that his sister had bipolar disorder. She was taking medication that caused weight gain, which she tried to hide. When he went to visit her on Nov. 9, he saw that her bedroom door was locked. He knocked and asked if she needed help. “She didn’t answer me,” he recalled in an interview after the meeting with reporters, adding, “I thought she was sleeping.” He left and returned a short time later and again asked to come inside. Ms. Jones had taken off her clothes, and he noticed her breathing heavily. He said she seemed agitated. He went back home. Later, Ms. Jones left and drove away, according to police reports. Her parents reported that to dispatch, saying she might be suicidal. They called her cellphone repeatedly, and she answered once. Then she stopped answering her phone. At some point, police arrived and entered the house through the unlocked front door, and then through the garage door. They fired shots into the ceiling of Ms. Jones’s room. In a statement released by the office of Mayor Rahm Emanuel after Tuesday’s announcement, Mr. Watkins described what happened next: “They shot my daughter three times, twice in her chest, and once in her arm. I believe that they murdered her.” Police also arrested Mr. LeGrier, charging him with aggravated battery to police officers and resisting arrest, according to the Chicago Tribune, which reported the charges on Wednesday morning. The newspaper said Mr. Watkins was not charged because he had been acting as an agent for his daughter, who was mentally ill, when she called for help from police. But on Thursday morning, a spokeswoman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez told CNN that prosecutors were reviewing evidence, including video footage of the shooting that was captured on a neighbor’s cellphone camera. Mr. Watkins has declined repeated requests by reporters to discuss the incident. In his brief remarks, Mr. Watkins thanked the mayor for calling for an independent investigation into how Ms. Jones died, but said that it would be impossible to get justice through such means. He also criticized Mr. Emanuel, saying that he should have done more for the family of Laquan McDonald, another black teenager whose death at the hands of white officers sparked protests last year in the city. The Chicago Sun-Times quoted Mr. Watkins on Friday saying: “I don’t trust the system anymore.” He added that he believed Ms. Jones would never have gotten out alive if it had been up to the authorities to decide whether or not to charge anyone with wrongdoing. “She’d still be dead,” Mr. Watkins told The Sun-Times. The mayor and other officials had no immediate comment about the father’s statements, but Mr. Watkins said he was speaking on behalf of himself and his wife, Sandra Baskin-Watkins, who is black. The couple’s two children are both biracial, with one child being half African American, Mr. Watkins told CNN. In addition to his anger over Ms. Jones’s killing, he expressed frustration that her parents were unable to see their daughter before she was taken off life support and her body cremated. The police department said it did everything possible to accommodate them, including allowing them to view the body and take photographs of her wounds. Ms. Baskin-Watkins, in an interview with CNN affiliate WLS, also complained about not having access to her daughter’s medical records, even though police provided some information to Ms. Jones’s mother and brother. She said the family had filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the Police Department, but they had gone unanswered for months. She said her husband and son had gone to City Hall and met with the city clerk and others who promised to look into it, but nothing came of those efforts, either. “We want answers to our questions, but we can’t even find that out,” Ms. Baskin-Watkins told CNN. Mr. Emanuel said on Tuesday that he wanted to make sure there was transparency about the case and that he would do whatever he could to ensure justice is served. “The mayor and others have made clear we will hold people accountable, whether the person was wearing blue uniform or civilian clothes,” the statement read. Ms. Jones had moved back home to live with her family from college a few weeks earlier, after experiencing mental health problems there. Her mother had tried unsuccessfully to persuade her daughter to return to school in January 2015, after Ms. Jones dropped out, but eventually gave her permission to stay home and continue taking online classes, Ms. Baskin-Watkins said. On Dec. 20, Ms. Jones went back to visit friends in Austin. A week later, when she returned home, she seemed agitated and upset, the mother said. Her father took her out for dinner, then drove her home, where they argued. The mother left for work at about 1:30 a.m., leaving Ms. Jones alone with her brother, whom she often looked after while she worked or attended class, her mother said. At around 6:30 a.m. the following day, Ms. Baskin-Watkins received a call from a friend who told her that her daughter was bleeding profusely in bed and needed to go to an emergency room immediately. When Ms. Baskin-Watkins arrived at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, her daughter had already been pronounced dead, according to the hospital and family members.

19,"CLEVELAND — Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her campaign on Friday, working to ensure a victory that is decisive enough to earn a mandate for her presidency and a surge of voters to help Democrats win congressional races. Emerging from a nine-day absence from the trail, Mrs. Clinton seized on the momentum of her performance in the final presidential debate, choosing Ohio — a battleground state where she has struggled the most against Donald J. Trump — as her first stop on a four-day swing. With new polls showing Mrs. Clinton closing in on Mr. Trump in the state, her campaign is glimpsing the opportunity for a clean sweep of traditional swing states. Reminding voters of Mr. Trump’s refusal in Wednesday’s debate to say definitively he would accept the outcome on Election Day, Mrs. Clinton said that as secretary of state she had visited countries whose leaders jailed political opponents and invalidated elections they did not win. “We know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship,” she said. She also portrayed herself as a candidate who could attract independent, undecided and even Republican voters unhappy with Mr. Trump’s campaign. “I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support of my opponent,” she said. “I know you still may have questions for me, I respect that. I want to answer them. I want to earn your vote.” Her stop here marked the start of a rare multiday tour of swing states as the Clinton campaign revved up its efforts to decisively defeat Mr. Trump on Nov. 8, including releasing a powerful minute-long ad featuring Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. The ad featuring Mr. Khan, who was attacked by Mr. Trump after he spoke at the Democratic convention, will run in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as other crucial states. With Mrs. Clinton holding a healthy lead in most national polls, Democrats have turned their focus to trying to ensure victory by as large a margin as possible, deploying Michelle Obama in Arizona and President Obama in Florida. The larger the victory, the less Mr. Trump and his supporters can claim foul play, Mrs. Clinton’s allies said. A month ago, Ohio seemed to be aligning as a Trump stronghold, as its large bloc of white working-class voters responded to Mr. Trump’s economic populism and America-first message. But the state is now back in play, with a poll from Suffolk University in Boston showing a tied race. Mrs. Clinton’s afternoon rally at a community college in Cleveland, the heart of Democratic strength in Ohio, was aimed at increasing early voting, which began last week. While early voting has traditionally been a Democratic strength in Ohio, the data shows potential complications for Mrs. Clinton on this front. Requests for early ballots are down 22.3 percent in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is, compared with the same period in 2012. Requests are also off 12.7 percent in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital, according to data compiled by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies voter turnout. A decided advantage for Mrs. Clinton here is the strength of Democrats’ grass-roots efforts. The party has leased 93 offices statewide, according to Chris Wyant, the Clinton campaign director in Ohio. Mr. Trump’s Ohio director cut ties recently with the state’s Republican chairman, Matt Borges, over Mr. Borges’s sharply worded public doubts about Mr. Trump. “They have an internal civil war on the Republican side,” Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, told reporters here. He added that two weeks ago, Mr. Trump was slightly ahead in the state. “But Ohio is really a symbol of the progress we’ve made in the past two weeks since the first debate,” he said. Ohio is not essential to Mrs. Clinton’s road to the White House. She could lose it and still romp through the Electoral College given her dominance in other swing states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado, according to polls. Mr. Trump spent the day hopscotching to rallies in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, a state where Mrs. Clinton has built a formidable lead. While he projected a subdued confidence at a rally in Fletcher, N.C., he also seemed to prepare for at least the possibility of an Election Day loss. “I don’t know what kind of shape I’m in, but I’ll be happy, and at least I will have known, win, lose or draw — and I’m almost sure, if the people come out, we’re going to win — I will be happy with myself,” he said. At his rally in Fletcher, he offered a slightly more restrained version of his typically freewheeling speech, largely hewing to his prepared remarks. Gone were his complaints of a “rigged” and “stolen” election — they have drawn condemnation by Democrats and Republicans alike — and he did not, as he has recently, try to counter accusations from the 10 women who have come forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual advances. The Trump campaign has said that it plans to increase Mr. Trump’s schedule in the final weeks, potentially holding as many as six rallies a day. Mr. Trump explained that he wanted to have no regrets, should he lose. “I don’t want to think back, ‘If only I did one more rally, I would have won North Carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes.’” Later, again seeming to acknowledge that he might not win the White House, he grumbled, “What a waste of time if we don’t pull this off.” Mr. Trump’s team increasingly views North Carolina as a state that is critical to a victory in November, along with others like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, visited the same town just last week. At a rally later on Friday in Johnstown, Pa., Mr. Trump took the stage with a renewed vigor — “I just got caught in the rain,” he bellowed, “how does my hair look?” — and he returned to his theme of a “rigged system.” Speaking to a crowd in the mill town, Mr. Trump cast himself as the champion of Pennsylvania’s working class. “The iron and steels forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation,” he said, promising to bring prosperity back to the region. “You were the leading steel producer in the United States — did you know that?” In Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of buying Chinese-made steel for his high-rise buildings. “I’m going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steelworker filing for unemployment,” she said. Seemingly energized by the more raucous Pennsylvania crowd, Mr. Trump ended his rally with a call to victory. “We will win,” he said. “We will shock the world.” Then, Mr. Trump, who, on the eve of a campaign trip to Scotland, admitted he did not really understand the nuances of the “Brexit” vote, ended with an ebullient rallying cry by predicting an upset victory. His win in November, he said, would be “Brexit-plus.” But a full day of events seemed to drain some of the energy from Mr. Trump, whose mood often rises on the strength of his crowds. At his final rally of the day, in Newtown, Pa., the Republican nominee began well ahead of schedule, spoke for just 30 minutes and wrapped up his speech at 7:31 p.m. — exactly one minute after he was originally slated to take the stage.","CLEVELAND — Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her campaign on Friday, working to ensure a victory that is decisive enough to earn a mandate for her presidency and a surge of voters to help Democrats win congressional races.

Emerging from a nine-day absence from the trail, Mrs. Clinton seized on the momentum of her performance in the final presidential debate, choosing Ohio — a battleground state where she has struggled the most against Donald J. Trump — as her first stop on a four-day swing. through Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. “We have a very good chance here of winning this election,” Mrs. Clinton told hundreds of supporters at an outdoor rally near Chicago Stadium before heading off to Washington for meetings with lawmakers and other officials. The last time Mrs. Clinton had campaigned in such large numbers was during the 2008 Democratic primaries when she visited all 50 states and won more than 100 delegates. But the new focus on the general election is just one facet of the race that will be played out over the next week or so. With polls showing Mr. Trump leading by double digits in many states, Mrs. Clinton faces a steep climb ahead of Tuesday’s contests in South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida. Her path to victory runs through a string of early voting states like Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico that are likely to vote later this month. And it includes two key tests: She must defend her home turf convincingly in Iowa, which holds its primary on Feb. 1; and then defeat Senator Bernie Sanders in South Dakota, which votes March 15. On Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton held a fund-raiser in Brooklyn, N.Y., highlighting her efforts to turn around what appears to be slipping away from her. It was her second visit to the borough since returning from her trip to California to promote her book about her life in the White House. In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has made stops in Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. After spending much of the day campaigning in Westchester County, N.Y., the Clintons took their car into Manhattan, stopping at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they were photographed standing among works by Picasso, Kandinsky, Mondrian, Rothko and others. They also stopped at the Metropolitan Opera house, where Mrs. Clinton posed for pictures with some of her husband’s favorite operas, including La Bohème and Don Giovanni. Later in the evening, the couple went to dinner with friends who included Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. “I am going to keep fighting until I can no longer do anything else,” said Ms. Clinton, adding that she would not rest until she could take back control of the country. “I am determined to change the direction of our country and make sure that every child gets an opportunity to succeed in school and in life,” she said. “It is my hope that we can get back to work together again, because there is still plenty of work to be done.” As Mrs. Clinton spoke, a sea of people stood in front of a portrait of President Abraham Lincoln that hung on the wall of the grandstand. A few feet behind the president’s image, another portrait of Abraham Lincoln stared down from a nearby ledge. In a sign of how far the Clintons have come, the crowd roared when Mr. Obama appeared onstage and delivered his acceptance speech at the University of Colorado Boulder. He called the United States “a shining city upon a hill.” And he urged Americans to embrace optimism. “The future belongs to those who believe in the power of dreams,” he said. “Dreams that matter, that inspire, that challenge us to reach higher. That bind us together.” The Clintons arrived at the University of Colorado at 10 p.m. after flying from San Francisco to Denver, arriving in time to watch the commencement ceremony. At 11:30, Mrs. Clinton arrived to give remarks to the graduating seniors. She spent a half hour speaking about her upbringing in rural Vermont and how she became interested in public service. When asked by reporters afterward if she thought the audience would be receptive to the message, Mrs. Clinton replied simply, “Yes.” She also addressed the graduates, saying, “It is my great honor to introduce you to your fellow classmates. You are part of a special family. We are proud of you and look forward to seeing you graduate soon.” For days, Mrs. Clinton has been focused on preparing for a difficult fight on Super Tuesday, the crucial round of primaries that take place on April 26 in South Carolina and North Carolina. Those contests are critical to ensuring that Republicans hold onto the Senate majority and maintain control of the chamber. While her team has been counting on Mr. Trump’s unpopularity in both states, Mrs. Clinton has been taking steps to try to prevent him from making gains. The campaign is being run by Stephen K. Bannon, the chief executive of Breitbart News Network, a website that promotes white nationalist ideas. His top strategist, David Bossie, is helping oversee the operation. The site has promoted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton as well as anti-Semitic rants against Israel. In an interview published Sunday morning on Fox News, Mr. Bossie said that Mrs. Clinton’s advisers had been aware of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for months and were not surprised to see him emerge in the presidential race. “They knew he was going to be there for a while, but they didn’t know it would take off so quickly,” Mr. Bossie said. “I think she had some reservations because she thought this was a little bit too early for her to have any involvement with this particular candidate. But I don’t think anyone was surprised by his rise.” The network has also pushed back hard against claims by critics that its writers are biased or paid for their work. On Friday evening, after Mr. Trump made comments suggesting that Senator John McCain of Arizona should not have received praise during the funeral service for his late son, President Obama called the criticism “hogwash” and suggested that the Clintons might want to rethink their relationship with Mr. McCain. A spokesman for the former president, Nick Ayers, denied that Mr. McCain was paid for his services by the news media. He also pointed out that Mr. McCain did not endorse Mr. Trump at the time the Republican nominee was campaigning against Hillary Clinton in South Carolina. “Senator McCain did not endorse Donald J. Trump until days before the election,” the spokesman, Matt Gorman, said in a statement. “The Clintons did not receive any money from Mr. Trump when he ran ads attacking Mrs. Clinton.” The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, who was in Washington last week to meet with reporters, said Monday that Mr. Trump had no role in the decision to end the long-running feud between the Clintons and Barack Obama over Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. “We had nothing to do with it,” Mr. Spicer told reporters at the State Department briefing room in New York City. “It was something that was brought up internally,” he added. “I can’t tell you what happened in terms of how we handled it, but I can tell you that the president has no idea why it ended up there.” The Clintons have long maintained that they never asked Mr. Obama to stop using Mrs. Clinton’s personal emails and that they did not authorize them. They have also insisted that they did not send messages to Ms. Abedin, the deputy chief of staff, asking her to delete a message sent to her husband, Anthony D. Weiner, a Democratic Representative from New Jersey, which included lewd remarks about women. Mr. Obama has repeatedly denied sending such messages. “If anybody knows anything about politics, it is that nobody has more respect for the Clintons than I do,” Mr. Obama said last month, adding that he had met privately with Mrs. Clinton several times since taking office in 2009. “She’s my friend,” he added. “I’ve known her all my life. She’s a very special person.” Mrs. Clinton has long said she did not ask Mr. Obama to change his behavior. When pressed by CNN’s Jim Clancy on whether she had ever spoken directly to Mr. Obama about the issue, she replied: “No, I haven’t.” The Clintons’ relationship with Mr. Obama dates to the 1990s, when both served as United States attorneys. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama was a surrogate for Bill Clinton’s re-election bid. And, according to people familiar with the matter, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama spoke often about Mr. Trump’s candidacy. After Mr. Trump won the nomination, Mrs. Clinton, who had already begun to distance herself from Mr. Obama, began to call him “Mr. Nice Guy” and even to refer to him as “that guy.” “I’m sure that they talked about it,” said Scott W. Reed, a longtime political consultant who worked on behalf of the Clintons for years. “But I don’t know if it’s a good thing.” In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has made public statements criticizing Mr. Trump’s temperament and questioned his business acumen. In one instance, she said that Mr. Trump’s personality could make him vulnerable to attacks like those that plagued George Bush.",GPT-NEO,True,
20,"VAULX-EN-VELIN, France — France may have just hosted its biggest outpouring of solidarity since the end of World War II in response to the terrorist attacks last week in and around Paris that left 17 dead at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. But in the disaffected suburbs, or banlieues, that ring France’s largest cities, those appeals for unity hardly penetrated the sense of isolation, even siege, that has left cities like this one living a parallel existence from the rest of the country. “I am French, and I feel French,” said Nabil Souidi, 23. “But here you are forbidden to say, ‘I am Charlie,’ ” referring to the rallying cry of solidarity since the attack on the magazine. Mr. Souidi recently graduated from a trade school and hoped to find a job as a mechanic. Months later, he is still out of work, searching for a Plan B. “I’ll go to Syria,” he said, with a sarcastic laugh in an interview over a plate of French fries and mayonnaise. For him and many other French Muslims, the nation’s preoccupation with last week’s attacks at the hands of Islamic extremists presents a mere distraction from a fundamental social crisis that has plagued France’s immigrant neighborhoods for decades. In numerous interviews, community leaders and Muslims and North Africans who largely populate the banlieues expressed concern that last week’s attacks in Paris would intensify an already explosive social and economic situation in the places where they live. On Tuesday, a French association that represents 120 mayors across France issued a statement warning that the banlieues were “on edge” amid the fallout from the attacks, and said there was an urgent need to address economic, social and educational shortfalls. Vaulx-en-Velin, a dreary Muslim-majority suburb of Lyon, is France’s third-poorest city and representative of the problems. Many youths simply call it “a ghetto.” It might also be called the Other France. Here, and in numerous other poor suburbs that ring French cities, joblessness runs around 20 percent, about double the national average. For young people, it can be as high as 40 percent. About half of residents do not have a high school diploma. Police harassment and profiling are taken for granted as the rule. In a time of budget cuts and austerity, conditions have only deteriorated despite years of pledges by successive governments, including President François Hollande’s, to improve schools and create opportunity. The men who carried out the attacks — Saïd Kouachi and his brother Chérif, and Amedy Coulibaly, who seized the kosher market — grew up in the French banlieues and had failed to hold down a series of menial jobs in their youth. All were attracted to Islamic extremism by their teenage years, and many residents in the banlieues consider them bad seeds who were propelled toward the fringe. Yet the fallout from their attacks, and the response shown by the rest of France, has been Topic A along the gritty streets of many impoverished suburbs from Paris down through the south of France. Many worried that as Muslims, they would be lumped together with the killers. Others spoke of fears of retaliation against mosques and other Muslim symbols, as well as the specter of reprisals or even a crackdown by the police after officers were murdered in the terrorist attacks. “People feel like there is no solution — that they are just totally divided from the rest of society,” said Gounedi Traore, 37, a social worker at the Centre Social Intercommunal de la Dhuys, a community center in Clichy-sous-Bois, a suburb outside of Paris that is one of France’s most economically deprived. “After what happened with Charlie Hebdo, I feel that this is going to set off a war.” Nearly everyone agreed that the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including a heightened security response by France and its allies, was a distraction from a larger problem: a sense of increasing social and economic marginalization that many cited as a root cause of young people drifting toward extremism. “The attacks had a global impact but not local impact,” said Faouzi Hamdi, rector of the Okba Ibn Nafee Mosque in Vaulx-en-Velin. Community leaders say France’s drawn-out economic crisis has made already scarce job opportunities even worse. “We are not treating the problem at its roots,” said Leila Legmara, a deputy mayor for education in the Paris suburb of Colombes. “Of course we need more security and resources to fight terrorism. But we also need to address what it is within our society that is capable of producing monsters.” The sense of marginalization did not disappear with the massive solidarity march across Paris on Sunday, which drew more than one million people and 40 presidents and prime ministers to Mr. Hollande’s side. For some banlieue residents, it seemed an almost surreal display that had nothing to do with them. In Vaulx-en-Velin, the only Charlie reference to be seen was a sign for the Charlie Chaplin cultural center across the street from City Hall, which is topped with a drawing of a flag of its sister city, the West Bank town of Beit Sahour. Residents there ridiculed the “I am Charlie” marches. Some said the terrorist attacks had been staged. While many strongly condemned the attackers for the murders, others insisted the cartoonists had gotten what they deserved. Local leaders say this city of 44,000 is a microcosm of France’s failed integration policy, and the underlying social problems that have encouraged young people toward radicalization. Places like Vaulx-en-Velin have remained “priority zones” for the government since 1964, some noted. As in Clichy-sous-Bois, youth here said they felt as if they were living in a separate country, detached from the social and economic benefits of the state and abandoned by a system that preaches unity and solidarity with France’s republican secular values. “I totally feel cut off from France,” said Karim Yahiaoui, 15, who added that he had not left this suburb more than twice in the past year. Over the past few decades, the Muslim community in Vaulx-en-Velin has become increasingly insular. “Many people only believe their own values now, not those of the republic,” said Anne Dufaud, director of the Mission, a nonprofit organization. She has worked in the community for 20 years. When Mr. Hollande led a moment of silence across France last Thursday for the victims of the attacks, two students and a teacher at a local high school, who declined to be identified, said many students refused to stand. Patrick Kahn, a manager at the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism in Lyon, who operates a weekly tolerance program in the schools of Vaulx-en-Velin, said simply, “The integration policy failed.” “The suburbs were left behind in government planning, so they became segregated communities,” he explained. Fear of the authorities was already omnipresent, reflected in crude antipolice graffiti on many of the concrete housing complexes, which residents call “les cages de poulet,” or chicken coops. The attacks only deepened concerns about racial profiling — already a common occurrence. One woman wearing an abaya said she had left the house only twice since the Charlie Hebdo attacks because she was afraid of the authorities. Inside schools, students said there were already deep social divisions between Muslims and non-Muslims. One community leader said it was impossible to open a discussion about the Charlie Hebdo attacks without first explaining what satire, caricatures and freedom of expression were. Several teachers said their attempts to discuss the events had led to tense exchanges. “Schools reflect the society,” said Stéphane Gomez, general councilor and deputy mayor of Vaulx-en-Velin. Mr. Gomez is also a high school teacher in the region. “We have to talk about what has gone wrong and reopen the debates that we’ve been afraid to talk about for so long,” he said. In Clichy-sous-Bois, residents said such a debate would have to include a hard look at the economic and social segregation that has defined France’s banlieues decade after decade. “We need to give people ways to succeed,” said Mohamed Mokkadem, 37, who runs a trucking company, SKL Transports. Mr. Mokkadem had tried, to no avail, to buy a copy of the latest Charlie Hebdo that hit newsstands on Wednesday. He said he was curious to see close-up the new depiction of the Prophet Muhammad on the cover. Conditions were already bleak in his neighborhood even before the killings, he said, and now, more than ever, he wanted to send a pointed message to the government and the country. “What we are asking for is to be respected according to our worth,” he said. “The message, quite simply, is to be regarded as truly French.”","VAULX-EN-VELIN, France — France may have just hosted its biggest outpouring of solidarity since the end of World War II in response to the terrorist attacks last week in and around Paris that left 17 dead at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket.

Palestinian officials demanded international action against Israel and vowed no letup in the demonstrations. “We are asking the world and especially the Arab World to intervene immediately to end the massacre of our people,” Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, an interim government that has held sway in Europe since the end of World War II. “I think he’s going to delegate to people like me, potentially, and others,” Mr. Brown said of Zhongnanhai, “is in part because it is the guarantor of the international order and the guardian of important alliances.

Those strategies backfired and ultimately ended up benefiting the oil industry. Overcoming three years of slumping prices proved the resiliency of the shale boom. Energy companies and their financial backers were able to weather market turmoil — and the maneuvers of the global oil cartel — by adjusting exploration and extraction techniques.

21,"MOSCOW — Two Chechens, one a police officer who fought Islamic insurgents and the second a security guard, were charged in a Moscow court on Sunday in connection with the killing of Boris Y. Nemtsov, a leading Kremlin critic, while three other suspects were jailed pending further investigation. Judge Nataliya Mushnikova of Basmanny District Court said that the officer, Zaur Dadayev, had confessed to involvement in the killing and that other evidence confirmed his participation, Russian news agencies reported, but no further details were available. The second suspect charged, Anzor Gubashev, pleaded not guilty. Despite the court appearances, neither the court nor Russian law enforcement agencies presented coherent pictures of the case thus far, including the roles played by the suspects or any motive they might have had. Mr. Dadayev and Mr. Gubashev, whose arrests were announced on Saturday by Russia’s top law enforcement official, are believed to be the two directly involved in fatally shooting  Mr. Nemtsov on Feb. 27. The three other suspects who appeared in court on Sunday, accused of being accomplices, were Mr. Gubashev’s younger brother, Shagid, a truck driver; Khamzad Bakhaev; and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov, the official Tass news agency reported. All five were jailed for up to two months. The main question many Russians want answered is who ordered the brazen assassination of Mr. Nemtsov, 55, a former deputy prime minister turned opposition leader. Since the shooting took place within sight of the Kremlin, among the most heavily guarded sites in Moscow, opposition figures have accused the government of complicity, which it has denied. The Kremlin had previously suggested that the killing was the work of foreign spy agencies, but President Vladimir V. Putin later said it was politically motivated. Mr. Nemtsov was one of the government’s most persistent critics and was due to publish a report that he said would reveal the involvement of the Russian military in the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has called Russians fighting in Ukraine “volunteers.” Given the intense national interest in the case, the arrival of the men in court was broadcast on state television. Uniformed security agents wearing black balaclavas frog-marched the suspects, bent over and wearing handcuffs, into the courthouse. Security forces established a tight cordon around it. A sixth suspect blew himself up with a hand grenade on Saturday night as the police closed in on his apartment in the southern city of Grozny, the capital of the Republic of Chechnya, the Interfax news agency reported. The arrests and the police activity were centered in the troubled North Caucasus, where Russia has battled Islamic insurgents since 1994. At some point, Mr. Dadayev was the deputy commander of the North battalion of Interior Ministry troops in Chechnya, state-run news agencies reported, but it was not clear if he still held that post. He even won a commendation for bravery, according to Caucasian Knot, a website that focuses on news from the region. The fact that Mr. Dadayev served in a force founded by Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic and the man given a Kremlin mandate to run Chechnya as he liked after stamping out the insurgency, suggests that the plot was purely domestic, said Grigory S. Shvedov, the editor in chief of Caucasian Knot. “More security people are working in Chechnya than in any other region in Russia,” Mr. Shvedov said in an interview. “Why would anyone try to recruit a killer who works for Kadyrov? It would be long and complicated.” Albert Barakhoev, the acting head of the Security Council in Ingushetia, a region that borders Chechnya, was quoted by the state-run news agencies, Tass and RIA Novosti, as saying the arrests took place there. The two main suspects, Mr. Dadayev and Mr. Gubashev, are between 30 and 35, he said, and have been in Moscow for years. Mr. Gubashev had worked for a private security company in Moscow as a guard in a hypermarket, Mr. Barakhoev said. Ajmani Dadayev, the mother of Mr. Dadayev, told state television that the two Gubashev brothers were her nephews. The Interfax news agency, quoting an unidentified source, said the police had been able to trace the first two men through cellphone activity around the location of the killing and from DNA evidence found in the suspected getaway car. There have been a series of high-profile murders of government critics in Russia over the past two decades in which the mastermind was never identified. Last June, for example, Moscow’s highest criminal court sentenced five men from the North Caucasus to prison for the 2006 murder of the investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a scathing critic of Kremlin policies in Chechnya and of Mr. Kadyrov. But her supporters say the identity of who ordered her killing remains unsolved.","MOSCOW — Two Chechens, one a police officer who fought Islamic insurgents and the second a security guard, were charged in a Moscow court on Sunday in connection with the killing of Boris Y. Nemtsov, a leading Kremlin critic, while three other suspects were jailed pending further investigation. Judge Nataliya Mushnikova of Basmanny District Court said that the officer, Zaur Dadayev, had confessed to involvement in the killing and that other evidence confirmed his participation, Russian news agencies reported, but no further details were available.","MOSCOW — Two Chechens, one a police officer who fought Islamic insurgents and the second a security guard, were charged in a Moscow court on Sunday in connection with the killing of Boris Y.

22,"For Dr. Dre, this summer was meant to be a victory lap in a successful career. “Straight Outta Compton,” a biopic about his hip-hop group, N.W.A., topped the box office last week with a $56.1 million opening. “Compton,” his first album in 16 years, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard chart. Last year, the music company that Dr. Dre helped establish, Beats, was sold to Apple for $3 billion, making him the self-proclaimed “first billionaire in hip-hop.”  But critics charge that the movie, which was co-produced by Dr. Dre, glosses over N.W.A.’s record of misogyny and ignores Dr. Dre’s history of physically abusing women. In a sign that the uproar was threatening not only his reputation but also his business dealings, Dr. Dre, who has previously spoken dismissively or vaguely about the decades-old episodes, confronted them on Friday in a statement to The New York Times. While he did not address each allegation individually, he said: “Twenty-five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I’ve been married for 19 years and every day I’m working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I’m doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again.” He added: “I apologize to the women I’ve hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.” Apple, where Dr. Dre, 50, now works as a top consultant, also issued a statement: “Dre has apologized for the mistakes he’s made in the past and he’s said that he’s not the same person that he was 25 years ago. We believe his sincerity and after working with him for a year and a half, we have every reason to believe that he has changed.”  This is the latest case of a celebrity who, partly because of the Internet, has been forced to face old abuse allegations. And for the accusers, Dr. Dre’s statement may be an acknowledgment of what they said decades ago.  In interviews with The Times this week, the women at the center of the allegations — the hip-hop journalist Dee Barnes; Michel’le, an R&B singer and Dr. Dre’s former girlfriend; and Tairrie B, a onetime labelmate — spoke about the abuse and about how social media had helped them connect and spread their stories.  “I’ve been talking about my abuse for many, many years, but it has not gotten any ears until now,” said Michel’le, who was romantically involved with Dr. Dre from the late-’80s until the mid-’90s. (They have an adult son.)  During that time, she said, he was often physically abusive, hitting her with a closed fist and leaving “black eyes, a cracked rib and scars.” Michel’le said she never pressed charges because, “We don’t get that kind of education in my culture.” She added, “Opening up and finding out there were other women like me gave me the power to speak up.”  Tairrie B, a.k.a Tairrie B. Murphy, said that Dr. Dre punched her twice in the face at a Grammys after-party in 1990 after she recorded a track insulting him.  She connected with Ms. Barnes through Facebook last year. “I said, ‘Hey girl, I think we have something in common, and we’ve never talked about it,’ ” Ms. Murphy said.  Ms. Barnes recalled being brought to tears by that message and a subsequent hourslong phone conversation with Ms. Murphy. Both women were writing memoirs — Ms. Barnes’s is tentatively titled “Music, Myth and Misogyny” — but did not expect to wage a public campaign against Dr. Dre, she said.  “The initial conversation was like group therapy, to heal our wounds,” Ms. Barnes said.  As the Aug. 14 release of “Straight Outta Compton” approached, others started the discussion. A blog post from last year by the rap writer Byron Crawford, titled “Beatings by Dre,” began to circulate again on Twitter and Facebook, while a Gawker post headlined “Remember When Dr. Dre Bashed a Female Journalist’s Face Against a Wall?” was published on July 31 and was viewed nearly 300,000 times. (In format, it mirrored a Gawker article from early 2014: “Who Wants to Remember Bill Cosby’s Multiple Sex-Assault Accusations?”)  At a panel for “Straight Outta Compton” this month, the film’s director, F. Gary Gray, was asked why the film omitted Ms. Barnes’s story, in which Dr. Dre confronted her at a party in 1991 about an N.W.A. segment on her Fox show “Pump It Up!”  According to a statement Ms. Barnes issued at the time, Dr. Dre began punching her in the head and “slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall.” (Charged with assault and battery, he pleaded no contest. He was sentenced to community service and probation, fined $2,500 and ordered to make a domestic violence P.S.A.; a civil suit was settled out of court.) Mr. Gray said at the panel that the filmmakers had “talked about it at the beginning” — the scene appeared in an early script — but ultimately decided the movie “wasn’t about a lot of side stories.” He added, “You can make five different N.W.A. movies — we made the one we wanted to make.” (Through Universal Studios, Mr. Gray declined to comment.) Sensing the renewed interest, Ms. Murphy encouraged Ms. Barnes to tell her side. “It’s about finally getting the truth out there,” Ms. Murphy said.  On Tuesday, Ms. Barnes published an essay on Gawker about the film and her assault that was seen more than 1.6 million times. “I suffer from horrific migraines that started only after the attack,” she wrote. “My head does ring and it hurts, exactly in the same spot every time where he smashed my head against the wall.”  She called the movie “revisionist history,” lamenting the women, including Ms. Murphy and Michel’le, who were written out. The movie “wasn’t reality and it wasn’t gangster,” Ms. Barnes said. “Gangster would have been to show everything.” As a white, female rapper signed to Ruthless Records, N.W.A.’s record label, Ms. Murphy said she had been expected to collaborate with Dr. Dre, but resisted his creative control. “He was very nasty to me constantly,” she said, and so she decided to address his chauvinism on the song “Ruthless Bitch.”  When Dr. Dre said at a crowded party that he’d heard the track, the pair began arguing. “I stood up to him, and I didn’t back down,” Ms. Murphy said. “He kept saying, ‘If you say one more word to me ...” Then, she said, “he punched me right in the mouth and again in the eye.”  While Ms. Murphy did not file a police report — “There’s no excuse, but this was a different time,” she said — a meeting was scheduled the next day with Eazy-E, a founder of N.W.A., and Jerry Heller, N.W.A.’s manager and a founder of Ruthless. “I was told, ‘This is a family business — you’re not pressing charges,” she said. “I was taken care of by Eazy in certain ways to be quiet.” (Mr. Heller did not respond to requests for comment. Eazy-E died in 1995.)  After Ms. Murphy reconnected with Ms. Barnes, “I had a lot of guilt,” she said. “Had I pressed charges, he would have had a strike against him. And maybe Michel’le would have stood up, too. Maybe it would have made him think.”  Since the attack, Ms. Barnes said that she has had trouble finding work in the entertainment industry: “His career continued, where mine dwindled. People side with the money.” Still, she rejects those who say coming forward again now is opportunistic. “What opportunity?” she said. “Show me the opportunities.”  She added, “They brought up the past” by making the film. “Not me.” Michel’le agreed. “They told their story,” she said. “I’m telling mine.”","For Dr. Dre, this summer was meant to be a victory lap in a successful career. “Straight Outta Compton,” a biopic about his hip-hop group, N.W.A., topped the box office last week with a $56.1 million opening.","For Dr. Dre, this summer was meant to be a victory lap in a successful career. “Straight Outta Compton,” a biopic about his hip-hop group, N.W.A., topped the box office last week with a $56.1 million opening. weekend that included an estimated $15 million for its star, Ice Cube. But after months of delays and setbacks, it seems as if Mr. Cube is not going to get everything he wants out of the movie — or at least the money. The film has been plagued by problems since its release in June, including casting questions over whether Snoop Dogg could play the role of Biggie Smalls, the gangster whose life he chronicled in his book Straight Up: My Life Inside America’s Most Notorious Gang. And now, according to several people familiar with Mr. Cube’s plans, he may have decided against playing himself in the film because he did not want to appear on camera while wearing blackface. In fact, some members of the cast say they were told not to participate in any interviews, either before or during filming, to avoid being identified as African-Americans. The decision to make the movie without Mr. Cube was first reported by TMZ, which said that Mr. Cube had asked producers not to include him in interviews. He also refused to allow anyone from his camp to speak with reporters, although those who spoke with him were allowed to do so. After all, Mr. Cube, 52, has spent decades trying to break into Hollywood. His breakthrough came when he landed a cameo in 1992’s Dream Warriors, in which he played one of two men killed during a shootout between police officers in New York City. Since then, he has appeared in films like Get Shorty (2000), Last Action Hero (2003) and Gotti 2 (2006). And despite his reputation as a rap artist, he has never acted. Yet critics say his appearance in Straight Outta Compton — a biopic about N.W.A., which stars Ice Cube and features music videos from such artists as Jay Z and Nas — is problematic because he does not look African-American. On Saturday night, Mr. Cube tweeted, “I am no longer interested in acting,” adding, “I will not be appearing in any interviews or speaking to the media. I am not interested in having my face shown on screen.” The tweet was accompanied by another message from Mr. Cube, saying, “I am not interested in talking about me as a person. That would be disrespectful.” A representative for Mr. Cube declined to comment. It remains unclear why Mr. Cube chose not to act, but there are reports that he had reservations about portraying himself in the movie. One member of his crew said Mr. Cube told them not to talk to the press because he wanted to keep his identity private. Another said he told Mr. Cube, “If you want to use your name, go ahead. You can call yourself whatever you want. Just don’t call us niggers.” Mr. Cube was interviewed by CNN last month and denied that he had made up the story about his ethnicity. He insisted that he was simply referring to his ethnicity as a rapper, rather than African-American. Asked whether he regretted making the statement, he responded, “No. No regrets. Nothing.” Still, many in the industry believe that Mr. Cube was telling the truth, given what happened in the past. Mr. Cube has long been known for his outspokenness, and he has spoken publicly about racial issues before. At the time of Straight Outta Compton’s release, Mr. Cube was facing accusations that he had used cocaine and alcohol, and he was also accused of sexually assaulting women. Those allegations were dropped in 2005. But even though Mr. Cube was acquitted of charges related to drug possession in 2006, he continued to fight the case in court. Last year, he won a landmark settlement in Los Angeles County Superior Court, agreeing to pay nearly $2.5 million in compensation to more than 100 victims. While most of those settlements involved claims related to sexual assault, others involved other crimes. “This is just another example of how important it is to stay true to who we are and stand behind our convictions,” said Mike D. Lewis, a producer who worked closely with Mr. Cube in the early 1990s and helped negotiate the payout. “It’s unfortunate that someone like Mr. Cube chooses to not be honest about who they really are.” Mr. Cube has always maintained that he is a musician. But he also says that he does not identify as African-American. “I am not African-American,” he said in a 2014 interview. “I am Caucasian, and I am mixed race.�” The label of African-American identity is often complicated, especially among musicians and celebrities. Some African-Americans embrace their identities as African-Americans, and vice versa. Others feel uncomfortable with using the term, claiming that it is offensive. For years, fans and journalists alike have questioned Mr.. Obama for his use of “superman” in a campaign ad. But now, after weeks of intense scrutiny over the ad’s portrayal of black people as violent criminals, some critics are questioning whether he has crossed the line into racial caricature. In an interview on Monday night, Mr. Obama said that while he was not offended by the ad’s message — which portrayed him as a humble man who would never resort to violence — he did not want to be associated with its content. “I don’t think I should be seen as the guy who does this kind of thing,” he said. “I think that’s inappropriate. It’s not what we stand for. We don’t condone that at all.” While the ad may have been intended to promote his candidacy, the president said, it had become too much of a distraction from the issues facing black Americans today. He added: “It’s hard enough to find jobs. You can’t just go out there and say, ‘Well, you know, I’m going to take your picture and send it around.’ That’s not how things work. And when you do something like that, you get called names. So it becomes a big deal. People get upset about it. They call me names.” A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee declined to comment on Mr. Obama’s comments or any other aspect of the controversy surrounding the ad. Ms. Clinton, in contrast, has consistently defended her husband’s record as one of the most successful presidents ever. She also pointed out that the ad did not mention President Barack Obama’s name in any way. “The ad does not imply endorsement,” she said. “We respect the fact that Mr. Obama is running for office and we hope that he will continue to run ads highlighting his accomplishments, but it is important to note that he has not endorsed us.” The ad itself was released last week, shortly before the release of the results of the presidential election. After being criticized for portraying blacks as violent criminals, Mr. Obama apologized on Sunday, saying that he regretted the ad was “disrespectful.” “I am deeply sorry if anyone was offended by my remarks,” he wrote on Twitter. “It was meant to highlight the successes of Black Lives Matter and others that have made our country safer and stronger.” At issue is not only the ad’s tone, but the context of its release. The ad was first aired during the final hours of the Republican primary season, as the candidates were making their closing arguments, and was quickly picked up by news outlets across the country. There was no indication that the ad would be used again, although many commentators noted that it was likely to be shown more widely. Some black leaders, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, called the ad racially charged, noting that it included images of young black men committing crimes and referred to them as supermen. On Tuesday, Mr. Booker said that the ad was a reflection of America’s history of slavery and segregation. “This is a very different era than we were in decades ago,” he told CNN. “There is a lot of anger here in this country about race relations, and it seems to come through very clearly in these kinds of commercials.” Even supporters of Mr. Obama conceded that they did not know why the ad was being circulated so broadly. One prominent critic, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, said that the ad was meant to draw attention away from the economic crisis gripping the nation. “I don’t see anything wrong with trying to raise awareness about poverty,” he said. “But you cannot do that by caricatures of poor black folks.” Still, he added, “I don’t think we need to be calling black people murderers.” Mr. Obama’s decision to apologize came just days after a new report revealed that he had accepted nearly $1 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, where he served as a top adviser. His spokesman, Michael R. Friedman, denied those allegations on Wednesday, saying that Mr. Obama had received no such payments.",GPT-NEO,True,
23,"It was Donald J. Trump’s chance to sound contrite and mature, to explain away the sexually predatory boasts he was caught making on tape and to persuade Americans that — for all his no-apologies braggadocio — he was, in fact, capable of feeling shame. Maura Cotter, 22, a senior at the University of Notre Dame, was shocked at what Mr. Trump did instead in Sunday’s debate: repeat, over and over, that what he had said on the 2005 recording, about forcing himself on women and grabbing their genitals, was simply “locker-room banter.” It was, Ms. Cotter said, “not an apology — no reason to believe he’s changed at all.” A classmate, Abigail Wilson, who is a registered Republican, listened closely to Mr. Trump and was reminded, she said, of the time she was groped by a stranger. The Republican nominee, she said soberly, “may not have physically harmed anyone with his words, but he has the power to do so by example.” Whether they love Mr. Trump or loathe him, many female voters interviewed across the country seemed to watch Sunday’s historically nasty debate through the same inescapable prism: a raunchy three-minute recording in which Mr. Trump told of kissing and touching women however he pleased. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” he said, loud and clear, on the tape. That is Mr. Trump’s new, agonizing and self-created reality: He may have uttered words about unfair trade deals or threats to national security, but what these voters heard instead was his voice on that searing recording, casually and excitedly explaining that he could sexually assault strangers with impunity. Some said they were so upset by what they had seen — over and over — that they could barely bring themselves to turn on the television and watch him in the debate. Others dismissed the tape as entirely beside the point, a decade-old distraction with no bearing on the presidency. “We’re all human,” said Gayle Mason, 73, a retired kindergarten teacher and a Republican in West Covina, Calif., who watched the debate on Fox News over iced tea. “When he becomes president, you’re not going to see stuff like that.” But on this, the voters interviewed all agreed: The sound of Mr. Trump at his most obscene lingered over Sunday night’s confrontation like an unbudging cloud. Several voters tuned in for the sole purpose of watching Mr. Trump explain his lasciviousness aboard the “Access Hollywood” bus. Joey Elliott, 63, who lives in South Bend, Ind., said she wanted “to see how he tries to squirm out of it.” From the debate’s opening moments, Mrs. Clinton grabbed hold of the recording and turned it into a rhetorical battering ram. In a measured but firm tone, she seized on Mr. Trump’s claim that the tape did not really represent who he was. “I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it,” she said. “It represents exactly who he is.” It was a striking and singular tableau: a male candidate for president being asked, by the first woman to share such a stage, to defend crude comments in which he had seemed to reduce her gender to its anatomy. Despite his best efforts, Mr. Trump could not quickly put the issue to rest. A moderator, Anderson Cooper, pressed him about the tape four times, wondering if Mr. Trump understood the gravity of what he had said, and whether he had ever carried out the lewd actions he had described. No, Mr. Trump said. Eventually, the debate moved on. After saying he was sorry but doing little to demonstrate remorse, Mr. Trump instead sought to turn the ugliest phase of his campaign into an attack on Bill Clinton’s past sexual trespasses — by turning Mrs. Clinton into a wife who had abided, aided and abetted her husband’s misdeeds. “There’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women,” Mr. Trump said, minimizing his behavior as language, not actions. “Don’t tell me about words.” Rarely has gender played such a significant role in a presidential debate. The candidates on the general-election stage, until now, were always men, and discussion of the sexes tended to be perfunctory. But Sunday night was different. Sex was a cudgel, a motif, a backdrop. It was never out of the picture. And the dynamics between the man and the woman onstage played out in powerful and unexpected ways. At one point, Mrs. Clinton deferred to Mr. Trump on a question about the future of President Obama’s signature health legislation, the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump tried a moment of male chivalry. “No, I’m a gentleman, Hillary,” Mr. Trump said, with a dramatic sweep of his arm. “Go ahead.” And with each response, Mrs. Clinton stepped toward voters in the audience, paying little mind to Mr. Trump’s personal space, as if seeking to rattle Mr. Trump merely by being a woman unbound, free to roam where she pleased, as a nation watched. In nearly two dozen interviews conducted in person and by telephone during the debate, women expressed deep reservations about Mr. Trump’s demeanor, interruptions and, above all, the dismissive manner with which he brushed aside the recording in which he casually bragged about assaulting women. Diane Crawford, 62, a resident of Greenfield, Iowa, was struck by how eagerly Mr. Trump sought to change the subject to Mrs. Clinton’s spouse and his infidelities. “He just kept throwing Bill Clinton in there,” she said, “and Bill Clinton is not running for president.” A skeptic of Mrs. Clinton’s heading into the debate, Ms. Crawford said she had changed her mind during those tense exchanges. “I’m not hesitant any longer to support Hillary,” Ms. Crawford said. “She showed her leadership ability with her response.” Karyn Sloas, 48, an independent in Knoxville, Tenn., said she had planned to vote for Mr. Trump until she heard about the recording on social media over the weekend. She was repulsed. She thought of the example that Mr. Trump had set for her 16-year-old daughter and her 18-year-old son. “I don’t want him to think it’s O.K. to talk that way,” Ms. Sloas said. The tape was a breaking point for Donna Stevens, too. An independent in suburban Valley Cottage, N.Y., she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Trump. Then she watched the recording. “What he said was appalling,” she said. For Mr. Trump, Sunday night’s early focus on the 2005 tape was the culmination of a remarkable series of provocations against women. His first appearance in a primary debate, in August 2015, had led to a highly public — and deeply sexualized — attack against a woman, Megyn Kelly, when he suggested that Ms. Kelly, a Fox News anchor who was among the moderators, had been menstruating when she asked him tough questions. He went on to mock the appearance of a female rival, Carly Fiorina. And he accused Mrs. Clinton of playing “the woman card” in her primary, suggesting that she expected to prevail simply because of her sex. Now, in the final weeks of the campaign, it is Mr. Trump whose campaign is imperiled by his careless approach to gender. On Sunday, Ms. Sloas in Knoxville waited for Mr. Trump to redeem himself in her eyes, by displaying real regret for his treatment of women on the recording. “He’d have to show true remorse,” she said. “We, and I mean ‘we,’ as in America, would have to see remorse.” All night, she said, he failed to demonstrate it. “I wanted to hear ‘I was wrong,’” Ms. Sloas said, minutes after the debate had concluded. “I didn’t get that.”","It was Donald J.

Maura Cotter, 22, a senior at the University of Notre Dame, was shocked at what Mr. Trump did instead in Sunday’s debate: repeat, over and over, that what he had said on the 2005 recording, about forcing himself on women and grabbing their genitals, was simply “locker-room banter.” It was, Ms. Cotter said, “not an apology — no reason to believe he’s changed at all.” A classmate, Abigail Wilson, who is a registered Republican, listened closely to Mr. Trump and was reminded, she said, of the time she was groped by a stranger. while waiting for her bus home from work in New York City. She said Mr. Trump’s comments were not only offensive but also dangerous. “I think it sends a message to men who are thinking about doing this kind of thing,” Ms. Wilson said. “If they can get off with just saying it was locker room talk, then maybe it’s O.K. to do.” The reaction among many young voters like Ms. Cotter, who have been energized by Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and who see themselves as part of the future, was swift and visceral, with some saying they would never vote for him, even if she could be persuaded that he might change. But Mr. Trump has always seemed impervious to such criticism, even when his own party leaders and allies were calling for a more disciplined campaign after a series of missteps and controversies in recent weeks. In the past week alone, Mr. Trump has called Senator John McCain and Representative Joe Heck liars and suggested that Mrs. Obama has ties to Islamic terrorism. He has repeatedly attacked Judge Gonzalo P?rez de Cuellar, the former United Nations ambassador who oversaw peace talks between Israel and Palestine, for being biased against Israel and accused President Barack Obama of trying to start World War III. And in an interview last week with Fox News Channel, he described Mr. Obama as having done nothing during his eight years as president except make things worse in America. “He’s made it much, much worse than I thought possible,” he told Sean Hannity. Mr. Trump has long been known as someone willing to say whatever comes into his head, but in the wake of the release of the video on Friday showing him bragging to Billy Bush about how easily he kisses beautiful women because he’s famous and grabs them by their pussies without asking for consent, he had promised that he was going to try harder, be less impulsive, and show greater discipline. Instead, in his first presidential debate since those remarks became public knowledge, he repeated his comments almost verbatim — and then added more. When asked directly whether he believed sexual assault allegations made against him, Mr. Trump responded, “Of course, you know what happens, right?” And later on Sunday night, when Mr. Hannity pressed him again to apologize for the tape — which he refused to do — Mr. Trump replied, “No.” Instead, he turned the question back to his opponent: What about Bill Clinton, the husband of Mrs. Clinton? “Bill and me we have great respect for each other. We disagree very strongly on politics,” Mr. Trump replied. Mr. Hannity tried to press Mr. Trump further, suggesting that his words in the tape showed the candidate was “unfit” to lead. Mr. Trump replied that it was a private conversation and that the media should stop talking about it. “You don’t want to hear anymore, please stop!” Mr. Trump shouted, before turning the microphone to the audience, where someone yelled out, “We love Donald! We love Donald!” The crowd cheered loudly. Mr. Trump smiled broadly. “That makes my life so easy.” In an appearance on ABC on Monday morning, he again insisted that “this stuff happened ten or fifteen years ago.” The next day, in another television interview, he said the same. But in a statement released late Saturday night, after the second round of debates had ended and before the third one began on Tuesday night, his team offered an explanation of sorts for why he has remained unrepentant in spite of his own advisers urging him to try to move beyond this issue. “The statements attributed to Mr. Trump nearly two decades ago reflect crude language by people seeking entertainment value and political advantage. They certainly represent my views today – absolutely nothing changes,” read a portion of the statement, written by Michael Cohen, who serves as both his lawyer and spokesman. The rest of the statement, however, did little to explain why the man running to become commander in chief would continue to defend himself with such language, or to offer any apology. It went on to accuse Mr. Clinton of “attacking our nation” with “her failed policies that destroyed jobs” and said that “the American worker is tired of losing ground and wants the government on the side of working families, not big donors and special interests.” In fact, Mr. Trump is trailing badly in polls and fundraising, while Mrs. Clinton continues to widen her margin over the Republican nominee as she tries to lock up delegates ahead of next month’s convention. But Mr. Trump, whose supporters believe the polls to be rigged, has continued to insist that he will win, and that the election may well come down to his ability to persuade enough Americans to support him. On Monday morning, at a rally in North Carolina, he continued to attack his opponent, saying that “she doesn’t have what it takes to make America great again,” but also saying, without elaboration, that “I am going to do something about this country that nobody else can possibly do.” He then turned to the subject of Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump, who had previously praised Mr. Obama for being born in Hawaii, has repeatedly questioned whether Mr. Obama was actually an eligible candidate for president because, according to some theories, he was actually born abroad. At one point during his speech, Mr. Trump even suggested that the former first lady might be involved. He said: “You know where Barack Hussein came from? You don’t know that yet. Where does he really come from?” When the crowd began chanting, “Kenya! Kenya!” he added, “We should look into Obama very carefully and we’ll find out exactly how you like it,” before adding: “Maybe there’s nothing wrong, maybe everything is fine.” He later told reporters that “there are people talking right now who say they think there’s a problem with President Obama” and that he wanted “to get an answer to that question, because I want everybody else to feel good and comfortable about it, too.” Asked if that meant he believed Mr. Obama was foreign-born, he replied: “That could happen.” But when pressed further on why he thought that, he offered no explanation, other than to repeat his belief that the president is hiding information about his background. “There are many reasons, there are so many,” Mr. Trump said, “but the main reason is we just want to be sure he’s qualified for office.” A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment, saying only that the campaign stands by its previous statements. on the issue. The remarks were not new; they echo what he had been saying on Twitter and at rallies since last year, and are part of a broader effort to cast doubt on President Barack Obama’s citizenship status and legitimacy as commander in chief. “The fact of the matter is, if he were running against anybody else, they would bring up these issues,” said Donald J. McGahn II, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. McGahn said that while it was important to address questions raised by the birther movement and others, “we need to move beyond them and talk about policy.” Asked what those policies should include, Mr. Trump did not offer specifics but said that he would focus on jobs, trade deals and immigration, among other things. The Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from his comments in recent days, after some Republicans criticized him. On Tuesday, it released a statement reiterating that he believes President Obama was born in Hawaii and saying, “He will continue to work hard every day as your next President to Make American Great Again.” Mr. Trump’s speech was billed as an economic plan for working Americans. It focused heavily on job creation, tax cuts, infrastructure spending and renegotiating international agreements. “If we’re smart and tough enough to win a war and keep our children safe, then surely we are smart enough to rebuild our roads and bridges,” he said. But much of his time onstage was spent attacking Hillary Clinton, whom he called “Crooked HIllary” and the worst possible choice for voters. “She wants a massive increase in illegal immigrants coming into our country. She wants open borders, she wants sanctuary cities and catch-and-release programs. And you know what? We want secure borders and a deportation force. That is all part of my program,” he said. The audience cheered wildly. “And she has absolutely zero respect for law enforcement officers.” The campaign was hoping the event would mark a turning point in the race, a moment that could help turn around Mr. Trump’s fortunes and propel him toward victory over Ms. Clinton. Instead, Mr. Trump appeared to fall back on familiar themes of anger, resentment and fear. His supporters seemed energized, but the reaction was far more muted than when he spoke last week in Phoenix. In his introduction, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called Mr. Trump a man who “has never forgotten the lessons of life on Main Street, USA,” but Mr. Trump himself spent most of his hourlong appearance on stage attacking Mrs. Clinton, who was nowhere in sight. “Hillary is crooked. Crooked Hillary. She’s got problems, big ones. Big, really bad. Really. They don’t call her crooked, though. No they don’t. Crooked Hillary. Crooked Hillary is what they call her. Not nice stuff. Crooked Hillary. And by the way, crooked isn’t strong enough. She’s corrupt.",Falcon,True,
24,"Wells Fargo’s board said on Monday that it would claw back an additional $75 million in compensation from the two executives on whom it pinned most of the blame for the company’s scandal over fraudulent accounts: the bank’s former chief executive, John G. Stumpf, and its former head of community banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. The clawbacks — or forced return of pay and stock grants — are the largest in banking history and among the largest in corporate America. A four-person committee of Wells Fargo’s directors investigated the extensive fraud. Wells Fargo’s board said in a report issued on Monday that Mr. Stumpf had turned a blind eye to the fraudulent accounts being created under his nose and that Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the branch system, had focused obsessively on sales targets and withheld information from her boss and the board. Wells Fargo’s misdeeds, which came to light in September, have at least temporarily become a more widely recognized symbol of the bank than its signature stagecoach. Bankers across Wells Fargo’s giant branch system were tacitly encouraged to meet their sales goals by committing fraud; opening unwanted or unneeded accounts in customers’ names; and, sometimes, moving money into and out of the sham accounts. While the amount of money customers lost was relatively small — the company has refunded $3.2 million — the scope of the fraud was huge: 5,300 bankers were fired for creating as many as two million unwanted bank and credit card accounts. In one detail revealed by the report, a branch manager had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts and a husband with 21. The warning signs were glaring and could be traced back at least to 2004, the investigators said. Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the national network of Wells Fargo branches, set up ruthless sales goals that even she acknowledged were unreachable. Mr. Stumpf, who had a long and trusting relationship with Ms. Tolstedt, left her on her own to run her department, the investigators said in the scathing 113-page report. Neither Ms. Tolstedt, who was allowed to retire in July but was subsequently fired, nor Mr. Stumpf, who was permitted to retire in October after being castigated during congressional hearings on the scandal, was available on Monday to comment. Mr. Stumpf cooperated with the board’s investigation; Ms. Tolstedt declined to be interviewed. All told, Mr. Stumpf will surrender $69 million, and Ms. Tolstedt will lose $67 million, including stock options that they forfeited last year. While those figures are bigger than any previous bank clawback, they fall far short of the largest clawback in corporate history. In 2007, William W. McGuire of UnitedHealthGroup was forced to give back $618 million over backdating options. Ms. Tolstedt’s lawyer, Enu Mainigi of the Washington firm Williams & Connolly, issued a statement challenging the board’s findings. “We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt,” Ms. Mainigi said. “A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion.” The board’s report, compiled by the law firm Shearman & Sterling after interviews with 100 current and former employees and a review of 35 million documents, said it was obvious where the problems lay. Structurally, the bank was too decentralized, with department heads like Ms. Tolstedt given the mantra of “run it like you own it” and granted broad authority to shake off questions from superiors, subordinates or lateral colleagues. Many things collectively should have raised suspicion, the report said. Customers were failing to fund, or put money into, their new accounts at alarming rates. Regional managers were imploring their bosses to drop sales goals, saying they were unrealistic and bad for customers. Particularly in Arizona and Los Angeles, where the toxic culture was most pronounced, some managers explicitly told subordinates to sell people accounts even if they did not need them. Because of the bank’s decentralized structure, the problem went unnoticed for a long time. When it finally came to light — thanks in part to an investigation by The Los Angeles Times — the bank was slow to take action. Mr. Stumpf was warned as early as 2012 about “numerous” complaints about the company’s sales tactics — from both customers and employees — but he ignored growing evidence that the problem was pervasive, the board said in its report. Much of the pressure-cooker climate, the report said, stemmed from Ms. Tolstedt, who led Wells Fargo’s retail branch network for eight years. The report casts her as a powerful and insular leader who set unreasonable targets, castigated those who criticized them and actively ignored signs that some managers and employees were cheating to meet them. “She resisted and rejected the near unanimous view of senior regional bank leaders that the sales goals were unreasonable and led to negative outcomes and improper behavior,” the report said. Timothy J. Sloan, who succeeded Mr. Stumpf as chief executive, was largely exonerated by the report, even though he was also a career Wells Fargo executive. As president and chief operating officer, he became Ms. Tolstedt’s immediate supervisor in November 2015. At that point, the report said, he “assessed her performance over several months before deciding that she should not continue to lead the community bank.” Mr. Stumpf, who retired in October, exercised all of his remaining options and converted them to stock — which he retained — in the months before Wells Fargo announced its $185 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Los Angeles city attorney in September. He held 2.5 million shares as of late February, currently valued at $137 million. Asked about the timing of Mr. Stumpf’s options exercise, Stephen W. Sanger, the board’s chairman and the leader of its investigation, said at a news conference on Monday that it was a routine move that did not raise concern. The $28 million that the board is taking back from Mr. Stumpf — the proceeds of a 2013 equity grant — will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, Mr. Sanger said. Nearly all public companies have clawback provisions, but boards are typically loath to invoke them. Wells Fargo’s example may inspire future directors, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and an expert on corporate governance. “I welcome the move,” he said. “I’m a shareholder of Wells Fargo, and I’m glad they did it.” Mr. Sanger took over as the board’s chairman from Mr. Stumpf. All four members of Wells Fargo’s independent investigation group were on the board before the settlement was announced. The report depicted the board as hoodwinked by bank executives who withheld important facts. It praised the changes the bank had made recently, which include ending sales goals for its retail bank employees. Such conclusions are unlikely to quiet the bank’s critics. Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that advocates stricter regulation of Wall Street, called the report a compendium of “too-little, too-late cosmetic actions” and called on shareholders to oust all of Wells Fargo’s board members at the company’s annual meeting on April 25. Two influential advisory firms have also recommended significant changes to the company’s board. Mr. Sanger said that the report issued on Monday concluded nearly all of the bank’s investigation and that no further terminations or clawbacks were expected. But other investigations — including criminal inquiries by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general — remain in progress, raising the possibility of criminal charges. The board’s law firm is still looking into reports that the bank retaliated against former employees who tried to blow the whistle on its wrongdoing. Last week, a federal regulator, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Labor Department, ordered Wells Fargo to rehire and pay $5.4 million to a former employee who said he was fired after making internal complaints about wrongdoing that he had observed. The agency has also warned Wells Fargo that it is likely to order the bank to reinstate another worker who said she was fired in 2011 after trying to call her supervisors’ attention to accounts that she said had been fraudulently created. So far, Shearman & Sterling has found no evidence of retaliation, said Stuart J. Baskin, a partner at the firm. “We still have a few loose ends, but we don’t think it’s likely to change any findings,” he said. Wells Fargo is eager to put its sales scandal behind it, but customers are not quite so willing to move on. The number of consumer checking accounts opened in February dropped 43 percent compared with a year earlier, and credit card applications declined 55 percent. The financial damage caused to customers by Wells Fargo’s fraudulent acts was relatively minimal, but the issue has loomed large in the public imagination in part because the bank’s transgressions were so blatant — and so simple. “People getting accounts they didn’t sign up for?” said Stephen Beck, the founder of CG42, a strategy company that studies banks’ brand perception. “I don’t need an M.B.A. in finance to understand that’s wrong. Our expectation is that it is going to take quite a bit of time for Wells to recover. You can’t just advertise ‘Trust me,’ which is what they’ve tried to do so far.” Mr. Sloan, the bank president, said at a news conference after the report was issued that he had some regrets about how the bank’s leadership — and he in particular — had handled the years of warnings. “In hindsight, I wish we would have taken more action and would have done things more quickly,” he said. The bank’s sales incentives should have been eliminated sooner, he said. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the law firm that compiled a report on the culture at Wells Fargo. It is Shearman & Sterling, not Shearling & Sterling.","Wells Fargo’s board said on Monday that it would claw back an additional $75 million in compensation from the two executives on whom it pinned most of the blame for the company’s scandal over fraudulent accounts: the bank’s former chief executive, John G.

Stumpf, and its former head of community banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. The clawbacks — or forced return of pay and stock grants — are the largest in banking history and among the largest in corporate America. since 2013, when shareholders began demanding more accountability by top management after a series of financial crises. Mr. Stumpf will lose about half his net worth as he returns nearly $48 million to the San Francisco-based bank. Ms. Tolstedt is giving up roughly one third of her net worth; she has agreed to give back around $19 million. Both resigned last month under pressure following revelations that employees at Wells had opened millions of unauthorized checking and credit card accounts without customers knowing. In addition to the clawbacks announced on Monday, both executives have also given up their bonuses for this year. “We believe these actions send a strong message,” Stephen Sanger, chairman of Wells Fargo’s board, wrote in a letter released along with the announcement. But they do not go far enough, some investors say. Some want the bank to fire Mr. Stumpf, who ran Wells for almost 35 years before stepping down earlier than planned. Others want him to be prosecuted. And others still are calling for the entire board to step aside so new directors can take charge. Many critics point out that the latest round of penalties comes only because of public scrutiny. They argue that if regulators were doing their jobs properly, such abuse should never have occurred. That is why many call for tougher regulation rather than just stronger enforcement. Regardless, the clawbacks represent progress toward holding managers responsible for misdeeds. Until recently, companies typically returned no money even when there was evidence that senior leaders knew what was happening but did nothing to stop it. Even now, few boards make any effort to recoup ill-gotten gains. Last week, Citigroup disclosed that three current and four former executives could face clawbacks totaling tens of millions of dollars related to the bank’s failure to disclose problems with certain mortgage bonds during the housing crisis. But those potential clawbacks came too late for Citi’s former chief executive officer, Vikram Pandit, whose retirement package included $60.2 million in cash and equity awards. He left the bank shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the firm with hiding losses tied to subprime mortgages. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase disclosed that its auditors had discovered errors in how much revenue the bank reported between 2006 and 2008. As a result, the bank will reduce earnings by $2 billion through next quarter. It may owe refunds to clients, including hedge funds, mutual fund families and insurance companies. Those clients stand to gain hundreds of millions of dollars each. But none of them will receive anything directly from JPMorgan. Instead, the bank must file amended tax returns to get the money back from the IRS. While the clawbacks imposed upon Wells Fargo’s executives are large compared with past cases, they fall short of the amounts being sought by lawmakers and consumer advocates. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, called for the government to force Wells Fargo to repay every dollar made off the fake accounts plus interest. She also wants Congress to require all banks to claw back compensation from top officials whenever there is proof of wrongdoing. “The question isn’t whether we need stricter rules against fraud,” Ms. Warren said in a statement. “It’s whether our political system has the courage to enforce existing laws.” Other politicians agree. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, ranking member of the House Committee on Government Reform, said that while the clawbacks sent a powerful signal, they fell short of sending a clear message to other big institutions. “If you break the law, your bonus goes away,” he said. “That needs to become part of the culture here in Washington and across the country.” A spokesman for Wells Fargo declined to comment beyond the statements issued by the bank and the board. But the company signaled that it would continue fighting efforts to impose larger fines or to remove Mr. Stumpf. The bank said that it supported the clawbacks but added: “These measures alone cannot address the root cause of the issues — unacceptable sales practices within our community bank division.” Wells Fargo said that it remained committed to working with regulators to improve standards throughout the industry. “Our goal remains to ensure that every customer interaction meets our high expectations for integrity, respect and caring,” the bank said. For most Americans, however, the $185 million fine is a drop in the bucket compared with what they have lost through years of stagnant wages. And even though some customers will receive refund checks from the settlement, many are still likely to be outraged by how their money was handled at one of America’s largest banks. In 2013, when Wells Fargo began selling credit-card protection plans without telling its customers about them, a consumer advocate called the practice deceptive. But as long ago as 2007, federal lawyers were warning the bank that the tactics could violate antitrust laws because other companies had been barred from offering such products on behalf of Visa and MasterCard. Yet Wells Fargo continued to push ahead with these programs until last year, after news reports revealed that employees had opened millions of fake accounts under pressure from managers who received bonuses based on the number of new accounts created each quarter. On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren accused the Justice Department of failing to hold executives accountable. She noted that Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which has paid billions of dollars over several decades to settle cases involving fraudulent activities like those allegedly carried out by Wells Fargo, testified before Congress this week while no top official from Wells Fargo did so. “The message sent today should not just be ‘Don’t do business with Wells Fargo,’” Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter. “It must also be: Don’t let Wall Street get away with anything again!” A spokesman for the department declined comment on whether any individuals might face charges related to the case against Wells Fargo. Prosecutors typically consider individual liability only if there appears to be evidence of intentional wrongdoing, although sometimes corporations plead guilty to crimes in order to avoid prosecuting lower level officials. It may take months or longer to determine whether anyone will be charged in connection with the Wells Fargo scandal. Meanwhile, the company faces continuing scrutiny over its treatment of workers and consumers. Last month, Wells Fargo agreed to pay more than $60 million to resolve claims brought by state attorneys general in New York and Illinois accusing the bank of charging fees illegally. Earlier this summer, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed suit seeking to block Wells Fargo from forcing customers into arbitration agreements that limit class action suits. That dispute is scheduled to go to trial next June. Also on Friday, Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio; Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey; Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon; Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada; Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon; Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced legislation aimed at preventing financial institutions from creating unauthorized accounts. They argued that the proposed legislative fixes were necessary given the failure of government agencies to punish Wells Fargo. “Wells Fargo engaged in systemic abuse of its customers, and yet instead of holding senior management accountable, we see the same old revolving door between big banks and Washington D.C.,” Mr. Brown said in a statement. “This isn’t right, and I won’t stand idly by watching my constituents lose trust in an institution that continues to fail them time and again.” One measure included in the proposal would require large banks to obtain written consent from customers before opening up checking or savings accounts. Another provision would make it easier for victims of identity theft to sue the banks responsible. Under current rules, people whose Social Security numbers have been compromised can seek redress only through mandatory arbitration proceedings, where disputes are decided behind closed doors rather than in court. The legislation would allow plaintiffs to bring civil actions in court.",LLaMa2,True,
25,"NICE, France — At times it was hard to know who was on trial, the smuggler or the state. The defendant, Cédric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives. He would do it again, he suggested. Instead, when asked by a judge, “Why do you do all this?” Mr. Herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of France’s practice of rounding up and turning back Africans entering illegally from Italy in search of work and a better life. It was “ignoble,” he said. “There are people dying on the side of the road,” Mr. Herrou replied. “It’s not right. There are children who are not safe. It is enraging to see children, at 2 in the morning, completely dehydrated. “I am a Frenchman,” Mr. Herrou declared. The trial, which began on Wednesday, is no ordinary one. It has been substantially covered by the French news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of France’s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into Europe and the quandary they present. France, foremost among European nations, prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism, fraternity and solidarity. And yet, perhaps first among them, too, it is struggling to reconcile those values with the pressing realities of a smaller, more globalized world, including fear of terrorism. The contradictions are being played out in courtrooms, in politics and in farmers’ fields, on the sidewalks of Paris and in train stations from the Côte d’Azur to the northern port of Calais, where the government demolished a giant migrant camp in the fall. On the one hand, politicians in this year’s presidential election are competing to see who can take the toughest line on securing France’s borders. Most are promising a crackdown on migrants, with admission reserved for clear-cut cases of political persecution. Terrorist attacks, including the one last summer in Nice that killed 85 people, have exacerbated anti-migrant sentiment. But in these remote mountain valleys, where Jews fleeing the Nazis and the Vichy collaborators found refuge during World War II, Mr. Herrou has become something of a folk hero by leading a kind of loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north, many destined for Britain or Germany. His work has won him admiration for his resistance to the state and his stand that it is simply right to help one’s fellow man, woman or child. Others in this region seem to agree. In the square outside the pastel-colored courthouse, hundreds of sympathizers gathered and shouted, “We are all children of immigrants!” Mr. Herrou got a hero’s welcome as he descended the steep steps late in the evening, trailed by television cameras. Inside, not even the prosecutor, Jean-Michel Prêtre, seemed to want him there and praised his cause as “noble.” He asked for an eight-month sentence, but quickly reassured the court that it should be suspended, “of course.” Still, the law is the law. “He’s demonstrated a manifest intention to violate the law,” Mr. Prêtre told the court. “One can criticize it, but it’s got to be applied.” The verdict, which will be made by the panel of three judges who heard the case this week — there was no jury of peers — is scheduled to be announced on Feb. 10. The appeal for leniency was both an acknowledgment of widespread discomfort with the law, as a well as recognition of Mr. Herrou’s growing status in the region around Nice and its mountainous backcountry, the Roya Valley. Mr. Herrou was voted “Azuréen of the Year” last month by the readers of the leading local newspaper, Nice-Matin, to the fury of regional officials. “I am Cédric,” read one of the placards in the crowd. “Long live the righteous of the Roya,” read another. The courtroom on Wednesday was filled with people from the mountain — the men bearded and ponytailed, the women in duffel coats — who had come to support Mr. Herrou and who were convinced right was on their side. The notion that Mr. Herrou is trying to uphold what he sees as basic French values, rather than violating the law, is much of the reason he appears to enjoy a considerable measure of popular support. The argument formed the essence of his lawyer’s defense strategy. Remember the last word in the French Republic’s motto, “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité,” his lawyer, Zia Oloumi, told the court. “They are saying M. Herrou is endangering the Republic,” Mr. Oloumi told the three judges. “On the contrary, I think he is defending its values. “You see, you have got this value, fraternity, and the dictionary is quite clear,” Mr. Oloumi said. “Think about the impact of your decision on the practical application of the idea of fraternity.” Mr. Herrou was not making any political points, Mr. Oloumi insisted. He was merely responding to a humanitarian crisis in his own backyard; the Roya Valley had become a way station for migrants. The judges did not respond. But the lightness of the sentence called for by Mr. Prêtre suggested that the concepts invoked by Mr. Oloumi had resonance. Mr. Herrou’s accusers seemed most taken aback by his stubbornness. Not every migrant Mr. Herrou picks up is by the side of the road. He finds many outside the migrant camp across the Italian border at Ventimiglia, looking especially for women and children. The presiding judge, Laurie Duca, reminded him he had first been arrested in August, near his mountainside home at Breil-sur-Roya, with a van full of migrants. At that time, the prosecutor released him, suggesting that Mr. Herrou’s humanitarian motivations absolved him. That first arrest was evidently merely a warning. “After August, you said you knew it was illegal,” Judge Duca remarked in court. No matter. Mr. Herrou persisted, describing his migrant-smuggling work to journalists last fall and even occupying a disused summer camp owned by the state railroad when his own modest homestead became overwhelmed. At that point, in mid-October, the authorities decided they had had enough of him. “You were there, and you were extremely active,” the judge said. “Why so much press?” Mr. Herrou replied, “It is right that society should know about all this.” The judge and the prosecutor suggested that this time Mr. Herrou would not get the humanitarian pass he had benefited from previously. The local political establishment is furious with him. “At the very moment when we need strict controls, Mr. Herrou’s ideological, premeditated actions are a major risk,” Eric Ciotti, the president of the departmental council and a leading right-leaning member of Parliament, wrote in Nice-Matin. Mr. Prêtre, the prosecutor, suggested that Mr. Herrou’s persistence and openness had been his undoing. “Mr. Herrou acknowledges everything,” Mr. Prêtre said, with astonishment. “This trial springs from a communications strategy for a cause that I totally respect.” And yet, “this is what he told the police.

The defendant, Cédric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives. in southeastern France, helping them cross into Spain and then back again, often with his own car, sometimes by foot, and always at great risk to himself and his family. But Mr. Herrou’s lawyer argued in court here last week that he should be acquitted because the French government itself has been encouraging people like him to help refugees in what is known as humanitarian smuggling — an illegal practice, but one that many European governments have tacitly condoned to stem the tide of desperate immigrants streaming across their borders from Africa, Asia and beyond. The case against Mr. Herrou — he faces up to three years in prison if convicted of aiding undocumented migration — was brought under a law passed by Parliament in December after France took up arms to fight Islamic State militants inside its territory. It has also become part of a broader debate about how much responsibility Europe bears for the influx of hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim asylum-seekers since late 2015, when they began arriving at record numbers along Italy’s southern coast. In recent weeks, Germany and Austria, two countries whose leaders were once among those most reluctant to accept refugees, have begun taking steps that could allow more refugees to enter legally. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said this month that her country would take responsibility for all Syrian children seeking protection in the bloc’s member states by next year. And in Austria, which currently accepts only Syrians fleeing war zones, Chancellor Christian Kern announced plans to open refugee centers in Hungary and Slovakia as well, so that they can process applications there before sending the applicants to Vienna for resettlement. But even the most generous interpretation of these moves does not go far enough. For many Europeans — including some who are sympathetic to refugees’ plight — it seems that any attempt to limit immigration amounts to appeasing xenophobes in countries such as Poland. “The idea is that you can do something without doing anything,” Mr. Kern told reporters this month, referring to the Austrian plan. “But I don’t think that’s possible.” In Nice, the trial has exposed deep divisions between the government’s tough line on undocumented migration and its stated desire to protect human rights. As the proceedings unfolded over five days, it became clear that Mr. Herrou was being tried not just on charges of smuggling, but for having helped immigrants to cross France’s border illegally and for being involved in human trafficking. He faces a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in jail, although it seems unlikely that France will ever send someone to prison for such offenses. The prosecutor asked for six months. The judge will decide whether Mr. Herrou deserves leniency when she rules. The trial, and its outcome, may set an important precedent for other cases around France — including that of another man accused of smuggling immigrants. That case involves Patrick Pelloux, a doctor who was charged with “complicity” for allegedly providing medical treatment to undocumented migrants, a crime punishable by four years in prison and €30,000, or roughly $31,000. But Mr. Pelloux’s lawyers argue that he was simply trying to save people’s lives and are asking for no penalty other than payment for legal fees. Mr. Herrou’s defense team has been careful to avoid making comparisons with the other cases — and has been equally cautious not to appear as though they are defending him on moral grounds. Instead, the lawyers say, the prosecution should focus on whether their client broke the laws against helping migrants to illegally leave France, not the larger question of why those laws exist. Mr. Pelloux, the defense lawyers say, is guilty only of providing humanitarian aid, while their client was doing the same thing but also helping the police catch smugglers and traffickers. “We don’t want the trial to end by saying, ‘Cedric Herrou is innocent,’” Jean Lainé, the lead attorney, told reporters outside the courthouse here. “It would mean we don’t care about people dying. We need to show we’re willing to change our law to help those dying in our name, not against it.” Mr. Herrou was arrested in October 2016 and spent more than two months behind bars in Toulon and Marseille, until prosecutors dropped charges of complicity and smuggling, leaving the charge of aiding migrants to cross the Spanish frontier, which carries a potential jail term of up to five years and a fine. He faces up to two years in jail if found guilty, though Mr. Herrou says he has never received money for the trips he made, nor did he make a profit. His defense is based in large part on a letter sent to President François Hollande, asking that France do more to prevent the deaths of asylum seekers crossing through Libya. Mr. Herrou is an electrician and father of three. In 2013, after seeing images on television of migrants drowning off Lampedusa in Italy, he decided to help them by driving his van across Europe and delivering food, water and clothes to people stranded at sea. He was arrested in October 2015 and charged with aiding illegal immigration, but was released without charge. The case against him has been criticized as politically motivated, but it is still pending. Mr. Herrou’s lawyer, Me Jean-Paul Teissonnière, said that his client had not broken any laws and had acted out of humanitarian motives. He also noted that the French government was aware that Mr. Herrou’s actions were helping save lives. The prosecutor’s office is seeking six years’ imprisonment for each count and €75,000 ($80,000) for damages, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters. The trial will take place from April 3 to April 7 in Montpellier, southern France, where Mr. Herrou lives. Mr. Herrou is one of several prominent figures who have taken up the cause of refugees since last year. Others include former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister under whom he served, both now members of Parliament; and Mr. Macron, then economy minister and later president. But Mr. Herrou stands alone among those politicians in having gone so far as to risk arrest to aid the migrants. He said in the documentary, “I am not afraid. I am doing what my conscience tells me.” In another scene, Mr. Herrou is shown standing in front of a line of cars waiting to cross into Spain. A man asks why he does this when it could cost him everything, including the van, which he bought with savings for retirement. “Because I can,” Mr. Herrou replies. He says the same thing about his decision to drive across Europe to rescue migrants, even though he knows that if caught he faces prison time and fines totaling hundreds of thousands of euros. The film ends with him being led away in handcuffs as his wife cries out: “You are going to jail!” Mr. Herrou’s supporters say he should be praised, rather than punished, for taking action on behalf of others who might otherwise perish at sea. They note that Mr. Macron himself has called for greater efforts by European countries to share responsibility for dealing with refugees. Mr. Herrou’s lawyer, Me Teissonnière, has argued that his client had done nothing wrong. “He has been accused of violating the law because of a political choice. That is unacceptable,” he told The Associated Press in Paris, adding: “The only way we can fight terrorism is by respecting human rights.” But the prosecution argues that Mr. Herrou’s actions put other drivers at risk of criminal charges and could encourage other citizens to follow suit. It cites a report issued by a parliamentary commission that found that migrants often pay smugglers for passage by boat. In addition, it notes that the government is already working with nongovernmental organizations to provide assistance to those trying to reach Lampedusa and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Sea. The prosecution’s request is unusually high for such cases, and is meant to send a message to discourage similar behavior. Mr. Herrou has also faced criticism in some quarters because he is white and middle class. Some critics say his activism is hypocritical, given his own privileged background. Others argue that the fact that he is an elected official makes him all the more culpable. “It is very easy to criticize someone else, and to criticize someone who is less fortunate, and who has no power,” said Mr. Herrou in the documentary.",Falcon,False,
26,"President Trump on Friday intensified his attacks on his own Justice Department and F.B.I. for their handling of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections, hinting that senior leaders there should face consequences for conduct he called “a disgrace.” Mr. Trump, who has become increasingly outspoken in his suggestions of wrongdoing by law enforcement officials as the inquiry has reached deeper inside the White House, made his comments as he announced that he had declassified a secret memo prepared by House Republicans that insinuates that the Russia investigation has been tainted by Democratic bias. “I think it’s terrible,” Mr. Trump said of the actions described by the document, which accuses federal law enforcement officials of abusing their authority when they sought permission to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. “It’s a disgrace what’s happening in our country,” Mr. Trump added. “A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, and much worse than that.” The release of the memo raised fresh questions about whether Mr. Trump — who last year fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director overseeing the Russia inquiry, and then sought to remove Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel named to take it over — might seek next to oust Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who named Mr. Mueller. The president, who first considered getting rid of Mr. Rosenstein last summer, pointedly refused to say on Friday whether he was more likely to do so now, cocking his head and telling reporters who pressed him on the matter: “You figure that out.” But the release of the memo underscored how Mr. Trump has transformed his own suspicions and unsubstantiated theories about an inquiry he has repeatedly called a “hoax” and a “witch hunt” into a set of official accusations of corruption against the very people investigating him. The president has called for months for the compilation of such evidence, often taking to Twitter to demand that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. release information that could show political bias on the part of those investigating whether his campaign colluded with Russia. Last month, Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who leads the Intelligence Committee and is a loyal ally of Mr. Trump, obliged by dispatching his staff to compile a classified document that seeks to illustrate just that. Mr. Trump was eager to release it. The memo described Mr. Rosenstein as one of the senior Justice Department officials who approved an application to extend surveillance of Mr. Page, and suggested that those applications deliberately avoided mentioning that they were based in part on information in a dossier paid for by Democrats. A senior White House official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the president’s thinking, said there had been no consideration or discussion of dismissing Mr. Rosenstein, and that the material in the memo had not altered Mr. Trump’s view of him. Still, the prospect of Mr. Rosenstein’s ouster set off alarms among Democrats, who said it would be an unacceptable move by the president to thwart a federal investigation. “We write to inform you that we would consider such an unwarranted action as an attempt to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation,” Democratic leaders said in a letter to Mr. Trump shortly after he made his comments at the White House on Friday morning. “Firing Rod Rosenstein, D.O.J. leadership, or Bob Mueller could result in a constitutional crisis of the kind not seen since the Saturday Night Massacre,” they wrote. They were referring to President Nixon’s order at the height of the Watergate scandal to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor. Elliot Richardson, the attorney general, and William Ruckelshaus, the deputy attorney general, resigned rather than carry out the order. In a morning tweet before the release of the memo, Mr. Trump said senior officials had corrupted the Russia inquiry with partisan bias. “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans — something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. He also circulated a quotation from Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative-aligned group Judicial Watch, who last year said the Obama administration had turned the F.B.I. into a “K.G.B.-type operation.” On Friday, in a statement retweeted by the president, Mr. Fitton accused Hillary Clinton and Democrats of trying to hide the fact that they had funded the dossier, which, he said, “was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the Trump Team.” In an afternoon statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the memo “raises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. to use the government’s most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.” Later on Friday, Mr. Trump visited a Customs and Border Protection training center to urge passage of an immigration overhaul before flying to Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Senior officials at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. had strenuously objected to the Republican memo, arguing that it omitted key facts, a case that Mr. Rosenstein and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, made to Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday. But on Friday, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, appeared to side with critics of the Justice Department. “Congress has made inquiries concerning an issue of great importance for the country, and concerns have been raised about the department’s performance,” Mr. Sessions said in a statement. “I have great confidence in the men and women of this department. But no department is perfect.” Earlier, during an event at the Justice Department on Friday morning, Mr. Sessions veered off script to praise Mr. Rosenstein, a 27-year veteran of the agency, whom he said represents “the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.” But some conservatives quickly seized on the declassified memo as grounds to dismiss Mr. Rosenstein. The Tea Party Patriots, a political group, produced a dramatic television ad calling him “a weak careerist at the Justice Department, protecting liberal Obama holdovers and the deep state instead of following the rule of law.” It said he should do his job or resign. Should Mr. Trump opt to act on the allegations in the memo, Mr. Rosenstein might not be the only senior official affected. Among the other officials mentioned as having approved the applications to extend the surveillance warrant was Dana Boente, who briefly acted as assistant attorney general in the National Security Division before being named as the general counsel at the F.B.I. Earlier this week, Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I., abruptly left after Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, confronted him about an investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector general into the events of 2016, when the bureau was investigating both Mrs. Clinton’s email use and the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia.","President Trump on Friday intensified his attacks on his own Justice Department and F.B.I. for their handling of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections, hinting that senior leaders there should face consequences for conduct he called “a disgrace.” Mr. Trump, who has become increasingly outspoken in his suggestions of wrongdoing by law enforcement officials as the inquiry has reached deeper inside the White House, made his comments as he announced that he had declassified a secret memo prepared by House Republicans that insinuates that the Russia investigation has been tainted by Democratic bias.","President Trump on Friday intensified his attacks on his own Justice Department and F.B.I. for their handling of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections, hinting that senior leaders there should face consequences for conduct he called “a disgrace.” Mr. Trump, who has become increasingly outspoken in his suggestions of wrongdoing by law enforcement officials as the inquiry has reached deeper inside the White House, made his comments as he announced that he had declassified a secret memo prepared by House Republicans that insinuates that the Russia investigation has been tainted by Democratic bias. “I think it’s appropriate,” he said. “You have to nominate people who can actually win because winners make policy and losers go home.” He added a few moments later, she said: “The federation was created by an act of Parliament.

27,"His victims call him the Butcher of Bosnia. His defenders say he was a nationalist trying to defend his people as Yugoslavia collapsed. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb general, was convicted of war crimes on Wednesday over the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s — Europe’s worst massacre since World War II. His trial, which began in 2012, was the last to be handled by the United Nations war crimes tribunal set up in response to the atrocities. Here are some in-depth articles from The Times’s archive about the man who shaped the image of the Balkans in war and in peace: A Times correspondent profiled Mr. Mladic in 1994, as the general and Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, became increasingly isolated in their rejection of an international peace plan for Bosnia. “Mladic’s first name, Ratko, is a diminutive of Ratimir (War or Peace) or Ratislav (War of Slavs). Ratko is a name typically given a male baby in wartime. The general, 51, refuses to be identified in any way with the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, created in April 1992 as an independent and multiethnic state and recognized by the United States and the European Community.” Forces led by Mr. Mladic kept Sarajevo, Bosnia’s capital, under a deadly siege for nearly four years. Some troops shelled their own homes in the city. Thousands lived in fear during those years, facing the daily threat of being hit by snipers. More than 10,000 people died on all sides. That was the promise made by Mr. Mladic on July 12, 1995, as he gently patted a young boy on the head in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. His bodyguards handed out chocolates to children. It was a lie. Over the next 10 days, his soldiers hunted down, captured and summarily executed more than 8,000 men and boys from the town. In 2011, Times correspondents wrote that mass killings were a trademark of Mr. Mladic and that they ultimately caused his downfall. After an international accord was reached to make peace in Bosnia in 1995, Mr. Mladic spent much of his time isolated in a mountain bunker surrounded by a coterie of officers. His moods were said to swing from rage to uneasy calm. After his indictment in 1995, Mr. Mladic evaded arrest for 16 years, despite the presence of thousands of NATO soldiers in the region for much of that time. The Serbian military long shielded him, paid him a salary and continues to pay him a pension. In 1997, for example, he enjoyed an apparently pleasant summer: He spent a week by the turquoise waters of the Montenegro coast, and he was host at his son’s wedding at a well-known Belgrade hotel where United Nations officials were staying. In 2000, thousands of women from Srebrenica won the right to establish a cemetery to the dead in their hometown — by that time inhabited almost exclusively by Serbs. Almost two decades later, the number of white headstones is still growing. The leader of the Serb Republic, the autonomous entity where Srebrenica lies, has officially denied that any genocide occurred. Mr. Mladic was found hiding in a village near the Serbia-Romania border, 16 years after his initial indictment by a United Nations tribunal. His arrest removed one obstacle in Serbia’s continued efforts toward European Union membership but raised questions about who had helped him through the years.",His victims call him the Butcher of Bosnia.

His defenders say he was a nationalist trying to defend his people as Yugoslavia collapsed. around them. In this war-torn country, there is no consensus on Radovan Karadzic's legacy, and that has made it difficult for Bosnians to come together in their efforts to bring justice to those who died during the 1992–95 conflict that followed independence from Serbia. On Monday, Mr. Karadzic was convicted by an international tribunal at The Hague for genocide, crimes against humanity and other atrocities committed by Serb forces during the Balkan wars that erupted after Slovenia declared its secession from what had been Communist federal republic Yugoslavia. He could face up to life imprisonment. Mr. Karadzic, 70, showed little emotion when Judge Orie told the courtroom he would be sentenced next month, but he did not deny responsibility for any crimes that were proved beyond reasonable doubt, including massacres in Srebrenica and Zepa and shelling attacks on Sarajevo and Gorazde. The verdict came more than 16 years after a U.N.-imposed arms embargo forced Serbs out of Bosnia. It also marked a milestone in the long quest by Bosnia's survivors and relatives to hold accountable some of those responsible for one of Europe's bloodiest conflicts since World War II. The verdict will have far-reaching consequences. If Bosnia can prove that Mr. Karadzic played a role in planning or directing atrocities committed in 1995 by Serbian troops under General Ratko Mladic, a former army commander now awaiting trial in Belgrade, the Hague court would then sentence both men. That would mean Mr. Karadzic's conviction for genocide could carry an additional penalty. Prosecutors said they would appeal, arguing that the evidence presented did not meet legal standards. They said they will ask the appeals chamber of three judges to overturn Mr. Karadzic's convictions and acquit him. Mr. Karadzic's lawyer asked the judge to delay sentencing until after an expected appeals hearing, saying there were errors in procedure. ""I think we should wait,"" defense attorney Vasilije Jovic said after the verdict was read out, adding: ""We are going to fight."" The verdict could take months to reach because a panel of five appellate judges must first review the case before deciding whether the conviction meets the required standard of proof. A decision could still take several more weeks. A guilty verdict means Mr. Karadzic would become only the second person tried for committing war crimes in the postwar period. Slobodan Milosevic was found guilty by another international tribunal in November 2006 of masterminding ethnic cleansing in Kosovo during NATO air strikes. In addition to being a defendant, Mr. Karadzic also served as president of Republika Srpska (Serbian Republic), which proclaimed itself independent from Sarajevo, and he led Bosnian Croats and Muslims against each other. ""It is a great day for justice. I am very happy. This man should never walk free again,"" Dragan Djuklic, whose father was killed by Serbian soldiers near Banja Luka, a town close to where Mr. Karadzic grew up, said outside the courthouse in Scheveningen. The verdict is unlikely to satisfy all of Bosnia's war dead, however. Many families, especially among Muslim civilians from towns like Mostar and Tuzla, who lost loved ones at the hands of Mr. Karadzic and his associates, say he deserves much harsher punishment than 40 years behind bars. The prosecution argued that the verdict against the 70-year-old former political leader and wartime military chief was necessary because he helped plan and execute mass killings. In a statement issued by his lawyers, he called the trial politically motivated and vowed to continue fighting to clear his name. Mr. Karadzic, known as Drzakovac (the butcher) in his home region, was born into an Orthodox family of modest background in eastern Herzegovina in the early 1940s. After graduating with honors from law school in Zagreb, Croatia, he returned to work in the small village of Kravice, near Trebinje. There he married Vesna Puscek and fathered two children. In 1974 he became mayor of Pale and later deputy prime minister of the self-declared statelet that was established within a few days of Bosnia declaring its secession from communist rule in March 1981. He was arrested for allegedly plotting with Croatian nationalists to assassinate Josip Brodsko, then head of Yugoslav intelligence. The charges, dropped after an investigation by Yugoslav security services, did nothing to diminish Mr. Karadzic's reputation for ruthlessness and cunning in politics, as well as his ability to inspire loyalty and fear. He moved to neighboring Montenegro and later joined other exiled leaders in a secretive group called the National Liberation Army of Kosovo (NLA). The NLA was formed by ethnic Albanians who had been expelled from their homes during the war in Serbia, but it also included some Serbs who were fighting for an independent Kosovo. In 1999 the United States recognized Kosovo’s independence and NATO began bombing Yugoslavia to stop Serbian forces trying to regain control. But Milosevic continued his campaign against Kosovar rebels, even after he lost power in Belgrade in October 2000. His death on March 11 at age 66 came just days before a new government is set to take office. “He will be remembered as one of the most evil men that ever lived,” said former President Bill Clinton. The Nuremberg Tribunal tried him for crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life imprisonment, which was commuted by Slobodan Milošević, then president of Serbia, to house arrest and exile. The International Criminal Court has issued three warrants for his capture on charges of genocide, murder, persecution, deportation and forcible transfer. The court says it still wants to try him. He died without facing justice, but the court will not give up its pursuit of his legacy. “The fact that Milosevic is dead does not mean we can forget about what happened under his rule,” Fatmir Hoxha, a member of Parliament for Kosovo and one of his victims, told reporters on Thursday. “We have a lot of work ahead of us.” As prime minister of Serbia in 1989, Mr. Milosevic oversaw brutal crackdowns against protesters demanding democratic reform and greater autonomy. After NATO intervened in June 1999 to halt those attacks, he led his country into civil war with separatist guerrillas, using scorched-earth tactics that left thousands of civilians homeless and killed tens of thousands more, according to Human Rights Watch and others. In December 2008, Mr. Milosevic was convicted at the Hague tribunal for atrocities committed during Bosnia’s bloody breakup, including ordering troops to shell Sarajevo’s civilian population during the siege by Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Orthodox Christians in July and August 1995. A few months later, a U.N.-imposed arms embargo forced the withdrawal of Serbian soldiers from Kosovo and ended his reign there. But he remained defiant, refusing to cooperate with investigators or acknowledge any wrongdoing, even when it became clear that he would eventually face trial. The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Dec. 22, 2010, for Mr. Milosevic to stand trial on four counts: committing aggression; violating international humanitarian law by attacking noncombatants; persecuting members of national minorities and causing mass displacement of people in violation of human rights; and obstructing investigations of alleged violations by his armed forces in Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia. In January, however, the Yugoslav War Crimes Chamber in Banja Luka, a city controlled by Republika Srpska, declared itself unable to conduct proceedings because Serbia refused to extradite him for prosecution, citing concerns over Mr. Milosevic’s health. A month later, the Hague court ruled that Serbia could no longer shield Mr. Milosevic from justice because it had failed to comply with previous orders to surrender him. In February 2011, the Serbian authorities arrested and charged him with contempt of the court. The next year, Mr. Milosevic was found guilty and ordered to pay reparations, which amounted to less than $1 million. His family paid a fraction of that amount. “I am very happy, I feel like I’m free now,” Mr. Hoxha said in a telephone interview, adding, “But the real freedom comes only with the truth being revealed about all these things that Milosevic did.” “It’s important for me to know why my father, mother and brother are buried in Serbia and why they died in such horrible conditions, because of Milosevic,” he added. “And it’s important to me that he be held accountable for everything he did.” Mr. Milosevic died at University Hospital Center Zagreb, where he was taken by helicopter for treatment for heart problems. Doctors had warned of complications if he underwent surgery to replace his pacemaker, so his lawyers asked for permission to fly to Vienna. But a judge denied them the request, saying he was too ill to travel and should remain hospitalized, his lawyer Vesna Pesic said. He died there. In Serbia, where Mr. Milosevic remains revered as a hero and symbol of resistance against Western imperialism, many expressed anger over his demise, saying it showed how little punishment his actions merited.",Falcon,True,
28,"BOSTON — Tens of thousands of demonstrators, emboldened and unnerved by the eruption of fatal violence in Virginia last weekend, surged into the nation’s streets and parks on Saturday to denounce racism, white supremacy and Nazism. Demonstrations were boisterous but broadly peaceful, even as tension and worry coursed through protests from Boston Common, the nation’s oldest public park, to Hot Springs, Ark., and to the bridges that cross the Willamette River in Portland, Ore. Other rallies played out in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Memphis and New Orleans, among other cities. The demonstrations — which drew 40,000 people in Boston alone, according to police estimates — came one week after a 32-year-old woman died amid clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., and they unfolded as the nation was again confronting questions about race, violence and the standing of Confederate symbols. President Trump, who has faced unyielding — and bipartisan — criticism after saying that there was “blame on both sides” in Charlottesville, tweeted Saturday that he wanted “to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!” He also wrote: “Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before!” It was an abrupt shift in tone. The president posted earlier Saturday that it appeared there were “many anti-police agitators in Boston.” Law enforcement officials were on alert throughout the day, wary of being seen as irresolute and ineffective after the protests in Virginia turned into running street battles and turned fatal when someone drove a car through a crowd. Officers in riot gear sometimes faced off with demonstrators to maintain order. There were scattered scuffles and arrests; in Boston, site of the largest of the weekend’s protests, the police said there had been 33 arrests, mostly involving charges of disorderly conduct. Boston, where officials had pledged to enforce a policy of zero tolerance for violence, had been facing dueling demonstrations, but a rally to promote “free speech” was brief and unamplified beyond the small bandstand where it was held. The event, whose participants appeared to number only in the dozens, was undercut by police planning and starved by an enormous buffer zone between the handful of protesters and the overwhelming numbers of their opponents. Organizers of the speech rally had said they were appealing to “libertarians, conservatives, traditionalists, classical liberals, Trump supporters or anyone else who enjoys their right to free speech.” “All of us here, in many ways, are true patriots because, in spite of that noise out there, we’re here to stand up for something very fundamental, which is called free speech,” Shiva Ayyadurai, an entrepreneur who is running a long-shot Republican Senate campaign, told the rallygoers, according to a video posted on YouTube. But thousands of others, fearing that the free speech event would be a platform for neo-Nazis and white nationalists, joined a robust counterprotest. “This city has a history of fighting back against oppression, whether it’s dumping tea in the harbor or a bunch of dudes standing around with bandannas screaming at neo-Nazis,” said a 21-year-old protester who identified himself only as “Frosty” and wore an American flag to obscure much of his face. Some counterprotesters shouted down their opponents — “No Nazis! No K.K.K.! No fascist U.S.A.!” — as state troopers used their bikes to keep rival demonstrators apart. “We didn’t want for what happened in Virginia to happen here,” William B. Evans, Boston’s police commissioner, said at a news conference after Saturday’s main protests. “We didn’t want them at each other’s throats.” The free speech rally, which had been scheduled to run from noon until 2 p.m., concluded by about 12:50 p.m. Mr. Evans, who said the event ended early by mutual agreement between the authorities and the event’s organizers, said the police had helped the demonstrators get into police wagons as part of a prearranged “exit strategy.” It was then, he said, that “we had some kids block the street, it got a little confrontational, but they were given every opportunity to move.” “We had to do a little pushing and shoving there,” said Mr. Evans, whose department reported that some people pelted officers with rocks and that some demonstrators threw bottles of urine at officers. Rondre Brooks, 36, who said he had traveled from Detroit for the counterdemonstration, said he was pleased to see the early end of the free speech rally amid the large number of counterprotesters. “It’s a very good look for America as a whole,” he said. But another man, who said he supported the speech rally and gave his name, after some hesitation, as Matt Staley, interjected to ask if those demonstrating in support of free speech were not Americans, too. “I think it’s awful that people can’t speak out to express opinions,” Mr. Staley said. The counterprotesters descended on the Common hours before the rally and found fliers showing white supremacist and neo-Nazi symbols. The leaflets, which other counterprotesters appeared to have prepared, urged people to “learn to identify these symbols and let anyone displaying them know that they are not welcome in our city!” “Charlottesville is what forced me out here,” said Rose Fowler, 68, a retired teacher who is black and was among the people who had gathered to march from Roxbury toward the Common, about two miles away. “Somebody killed for fighting for me. What is wrong with me if I can’t fight for myself and others?” Although the protests in Boston were expected to be the weekend’s largest, people gathered on Friday evening in Portland for an “Eclipse Hate” rally. The Oregon protest swelled to more than 1,000 people, and demonstrators swarmed two of Portland’s bridges, halting traffic in both directions and chanting: “Whose bridge? Our bridge!” In Arkansas, a small demonstration supporting Confederate symbols drew about 50 people in Hot Springs. Opponents walked by occasionally, denouncing Mr. Trump and racial hatred. At least three people were arrested. And along a side street in Charlottesville, the mood was somber about 1:30 p.m., as people marked the time a week earlier when a man drove his car into a crowd, killing Heather D. Heyer. Ms. Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, stood before a memorial of flowers and candles, weeping as she leaned into her husband, Kim Bro. Hundreds of people gathered around as someone wrote with purple chalk — Ms. Heyer’s favorite color — on the pavement, “I miss you baby girl, love mom.” Ms. Bro eventually encouraged people to come closer to her. Some people laid hands on her, and they sang “This Little Light of Mine.” Ms. Bro said she hoped that some good could come out of her daughter’s death. And for those who might take joy in seeing her grieve, she said, “Karma’s a you know what.” Law enforcement officials made extensive plans for the demonstrations in the wake of the Virginia bloodshed. In Dallas, where a gunman killed five police officers who were protecting a protest in July 2016, the authorities formed a barricade around Saturday’s demonstration site with buses and dump trucks to “lock down” the area and keep any cars from drawing too close. As sunset approached at a Confederate monument in the city, people engaged in shouting matches, but no violence, while state troopers stood guard and helicopters flew overhead. As the rally outside City Hall was winding down, tensions heightened at the Confederate monument at a park nearby. Shouting matches erupted between protesters wearing bandannas over their faces and a group of counterprotesters wearing Confederate belt buckles and flags. Water bottles were thrown at police officers on horseback, and water and what appeared to be urine were sprayed on the Confederate supporters. One monument supporter, wearing a red “Make America Great Again” cap, declined to give his real name but identified himself as Wiggz, a 32-year-old Dallas resident. “They can call it an anti-white-supremacist rally all they want,” he said. “I don’t believe it is. I think it’s an anti-Trump rally. And that’s why I’m here. I’m a Trump supporter, and I’m not a white supremacist at all.” Before the Dallas protests began, several men and women armed with high-powered rifles and dressed in military fatigues assembled near a rally site. A representative of the group, called the Texas Elite III%, said they planned to provide security at the rally and were not affiliated with either side. “With Charlottesville and how things went down there, and what we’ve heard so far intel-wise, we are expecting possible problems,” said the representative, who declined to give her real name and identified herself as Momma Doc. The Boston authorities seemed to face nothing of that sort on Saturday, but they cleared the Common of vendors and their carts and shut down the Swan Boats, a nearby tourist attraction. Tensions here had been rising all week. On Monday night, a teenager threw a rock at the New England Holocaust Memorial, shattering the glass; passers-by quickly tackled the youth before the police arrived. But elsewhere in the country, officials were moving to defuse anger that surrounded the revived debate about Confederate monuments. Duke University announced early Saturday that it had removed a recently vandalized statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee from the entrance to its campus chapel in Durham, N.C. “I took this course of action to protect Duke Chapel, to ensure the vital safety of students and community members who worship there, and above all to express the deep and abiding values of our university,” Vincent E. Price, the university’s president, said in an email to students, employees and alumni. Dr. Price said the statue would be “preserved so that students can study Duke’s complex past and take part in a more inclusive future.”","BOSTON — Tens of thousands of demonstrators, emboldened and unnerved by the eruption of fatal violence in Virginia last weekend, surged into the nation’s streets and parks on Saturday to denounce racism, white supremacy and Nazism. Demonstrations were boisterous but broadly peaceful, even as tension and worry coursed through protests from Boston Common, the nation’s oldest public park, to Hot Springs, Ark., and to the bridges that cross the Willamette River in Portland, Ore.

The demonstrations — which drew 40,000 people in Boston alone, according to police estimates, took to the streets in other cities around the world. Captain Sudani picked up the white Kia in the eastern Baghdad neighborhood of Al Khadra. As usual, he phoned the Falcons to discuss where they would intercept him. The plan began to unravel as soon as he veered off the city’s meal debt after raising $1,000. A YouCaring page has raised more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The election was a success for the left-leaning Green Party, led by 30-year-old Jesse Klaver, a relative political newcomer, whose leadership at least tripled the party’s seats, making it the fifth-place finisher and potentially a part of the government. Mr. Wampler, of Los Osos, Calif., described himself as a 68-year-old hippie, and Kenneth Mendehbach, of Crescent, Ore., a woodworker by profession, boasted of spending at least two decades protesting federal power. Jeff Banta of Yerington, Nev., was one of the most important annual events The demonstrations — which drew 40,000 people in Boston alone, according to police estimates, took to the streets in spontaneous celebration.

29,"• Bruno Mars swept the top categories, winning album, record and song of the year. • Our writers and critics weigh in on the best and worst moments of the Grammys. • Kendrick Lamar won five awards. Alessia Cara won best new artist. • See all the winners and the red carpet looks. • The music industry acknowledged #MeToo during the ceremony and on the red carpet. The 60th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday gave its highest accolades to Bruno Mars, an upbeat master of danceable pop, even as the show wrestled with a range of social and political topics including immigration, race and the #MeToo movement. Mr. Mars won all six of the awards he was nominated for, including the top prizes of album, record and song of the year. The next most rewarded artist was Kendrick Lamar, the provocative and critically admired rapper from Compton, Calif., whose five wins included a sweep of the rap categories. Their victories came at the expense of Jay-Z, now a reigning elder of hip-hop and the music business in general, who had arrived as the most-nominated artist of the night, with eight nods, but went home empty-handed. The show at Madison Square Garden also featured the Grammys’ much-anticipated response to the #MeToo movement. While the reckoning over harassment and gender equality has swept over Hollywood, media and politics, its effect on the music industry had been minimal, leading to scrutiny over how the show would address the issue. But a call-to-arms by Janelle Monáe, and an emotional performance by Kesha, approached it head-on. “You see, it’s not just going on in Hollywood, it’s not just going on in Washington,” Ms. Monáe said. “It’s right here in our industry as well.” “And just as we have the power to shape culture,” she added, “we also have the power to undo a culture that does not serve us well.” Mr. Mars, who has earned the respect of the industry as an all-around entertainer, capable of repeatedly scaling the pop charts and entertaining the nation at the Super Bowl, won album of the year for “24K Magic,” as well as record of the year for the title track and song of the year — a songwriters’ award — for “That’s What I Like.” (His album also claimed an engineering prize.) Song of the year went to Mr. Mars and the seven other writers of “That’s What I Like,” a slice of 1980s-throwback funk. Accepting the award, Mr. Mars was surrounded by what looked like an entourage, but they were the credited writers of the song, reflecting the new production model of pop music in which huge teams of specialized writers collaborate. “I’ve been knowing these guys for over a decade,” Mr. Mars said. “All the music-business horror stories you’ve seen in the movies, we’ve been through all of them.” “It’s an honor to share this with you all tonight,” he told them. In addition to Mr. Mars, they were Christopher Brody Brown, James Fauntleroy, Philip Lawrence, and the quartet known as the Stereotypes: Ray Charles McCullough II, Jeremy Reeves, Ray Romulus and Jonathan Yip. In the days leading up the awards, the Grammys faced questions how the show — and the music industry at large — would respond to the #MeToo movement and the show of solidarity at the Golden Globes this month, when the women of Hollywood, wearing black, presented a united front. In a forceful speech, Ms. Monáe spoke for the women of the music industry, calling for a unified response of the women in music against sexism and sexual harassment, saying, “We come in peace but we mean business.” Then Kesha sang “Praying,” her ballad of anger and redemption, surrounded by women all in white, including the singers Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Julia Michaels and Andra Day and the Resistance Revival Chorus, a collective of women who sing protest songs. Kesha became pop’s symbol of the fight against sexual assault when, in a 2014 lawsuit, she accused her producer, Dr. Luke, of inflicting years of abuse. (Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, in turn accused Kesha of fabricating the story in an attempt to escape her recording contracts.) Her voice breaking, Kesha sang “You brought the flames and you put me through hell,” and “When I’m finished, they won’t even know your name.” As she finished, she held back tears and the choir gathered around her in a group embrace. Immediately afterward, Ms. Cabello, a young Cuban-Amerian singer who had been part of Kesha’s performance, introduced a segment highlighting immigration, with the cameras turning to a view of the Statue of Liberty and Emma Lazarus’s poem “The New Colossus” (“Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”). Then U2 performed its song “Get Out of Your Own Way” on a barge in New York harbor. (The performance had been taped two nights before.) [ Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder. ] The 60th annual Grammy Awards opened with a striking conceptual performance by Kendrick Lamar and by Bono and the Edge of U2, with Dave Chappelle serving as a one-man Greek chorus. It walked a fine line between confrontational political commentary and grounding comedy. Mr. Lamar began surrounded by phalanxes of soldiers in camouflage fatigues as he began his song “XXX” with images of the American flag waving behind him on digital screens. After the words “This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar” flashed behind him, and a brief appearance by Bono and the Edge, the camera cut to Mr. Chappelle, who said: “The only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America.” The show then alternated again between Mr. Lamar and Mr. Chappelle, before ending with Mr. Lamar standing among men in red hoodies who were gunned down one by one. Lady Gaga then took the stage to sing her ballads “Joanne” and “Million Reasons” at a white piano draped with the wings of a bird or an angel. “Time’s up,” she said. Mr. Lamar next won the first prize of the night, for best rap/sung performance, for “LOYALTY.,” featuring Rihanna, who told him: “Congrats. You deserve this, man.” Accepting the award for best rap album for “DAMN.,” Mr. Lamar delivered a paean to hip-hop itself, which, he said, had “showed me the true definition of what an artist was.” “From the jump I thought it was about the accolades, and the cars and the clothes,” Mr. Lamar said. “But it’s really about expressing yourself, putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that.” Then he paid tribute to his artistic heroes, including Jay-Z, Nas and Puff Daddy, and added, as the ultimate obeisance: “Jay for president.” There were other notable performances. Dressed in a glowing white suit, Childish Gambino — the musical persona of Donald Glover, who has won Golden Globes and Emmys as an actor — performed “Terrified” as a slithery erotic fantasy fully of falsetto and a gentle funk groove. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee played their monster Latin pop hit “Despacito,” surrounded by grinding couples, the women in ultrashort shorts or nude-colored showgirl get-ups. Rihanna sang “Wild Thoughts” with Bryson Tiller and DJ Khaled, fully in character as a big-voiced hype man. Elton John played his “Tiny Dancer” with Miley Cyrus. And Sting, strangely ubiquitous in the show, played his 1987 song “Englishman in New York” as a Police-style smooth groove. Alessia Cara, a 21-year-old Canadian pop singer who has songs of empowerment like “Scars to Your Beautiful,” took home one of the ceremony’s big four awards. After the microphone was lowered reach her, Ms. Cara said: “Holy cow, I’m shaking. I’ve been pretend-winning Grammys since I was a kid, like in my shower.” All but nine of the 84 awards were given out at a nontelevised ceremony in the afternoon. During the preshow ceremony, Mr. Lamar won best rap performance, best rap song and best music video, all for “HUMBLE.” Mr. Mars won best R&B performance and R&B song for “That’s What I Like,” and best R&B album for “24K Magic.” Despite 21 past wins, Jay-Z has never taken home a Grammy in the top categories, and that did not change at Sunday’s ceremony. The rapper, who was feted as an “industry icon” at Clive Davis’s glittery annual pre-Grammy party, was shut out. Ed Sheeran, who was snubbed in the top categories, was awarded best pop vocal album, in absentia, for “÷,” one of last year’s biggest hits. He also won best pop solo performance for “Shape of You.” Childish Gambino won best traditional R&B performance for his song “Redbone,” a 1970s funk throwback that was a surprise hit at radio last year. The country singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton won two awards in the preshow ceremony: best country solo performance for “Either Way,” and best country song for “Broken Halos,” which Mr. Stapleton wrote with Mike Henderson. Jason Isbell also won two: best Americana album, for “The Nashville Sound,” and best American roots song, for “If We Were Vampires.” Carrie Fisher won a posthumous Grammy — her first — in the best spoken word album category, for “The Princess Diarist.” After Mr. Stapleton won best country album for “From A Room: Volume 1,” the country singers Eric Church, Maren Morris and the Brothers Osborne offered a tribute to the victims of violence at music events. Ms. Morris began the introduction drawing a connection between the bombing in Manchester, England, last May and the shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas in October. “All country music was reminded in the most tragic way,” Mr. Church said, the connection we share with our fans and the healing power of music will always provide.” As they played a quiet and stripped-down version of Eric Clapton’s “Tears in Heaven,” the names of individual victims were displayed on glowing panels behind them, as if electronic votive candles. The Grammys, like most awards shows, have been wrestling for years with issues of diversity: ethnic, gender and, in the Grammys’ case, musical. Not so long ago, the show drew eye rolls for over-rewarding elder heroes at the expense of pop’s younger, more vital mainstream. (Think Ray Charles beating Green Day and Kanye West in 2005, or Herbie Hancock defeating Amy Winehouse and, ahem, Mr. West in 2008.) The Grammys have generally gotten much better at recognizing the pulse of contemporary music. A diverse crop of nominees this year made it likely that the winners of the four most prestigious categories — album, record and song of the year, and best new artist — would not be white men. At the same time, gender remained very much still an issue. Lorde was the only woman up for album of the year; she did not perform at the ceremony. Julia Michaels and Ms. Cara have credits in the song of the year category (which recognizes songwriters). Otherwise, the top nominees were predominantly male. As a new report indicated, gender diversity at the Grammys — and in the music industry at large — has been abysmal. As the Grammys approached, it became clear that aside from the performance by Kesha, the industry had no organized response to the #MeToo movement planned along the lines of the Time’s Up campaign that was front and center at the recent Golden Globes. That changed just days ago, when a small group of midlevel female music executives called for artists to wear a white rose to the show, as a sign of “hope, peace, sympathy and resistance.” By Thursday, a handful of stars including Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson had pledged their support. On Sunday, the group circulated a list of music-industry professionals and artists who had signed on to the effort, adding Pink, Dua Lipa and Lil Uzi Vert, among others. At the preshow ceremony, several artists wore white roses, although their comments about it were muted. Reba McEntire, the country star, was asked about the white rose on her dress after she won best roots gospel album for “Sing It Now: Songs of Faith & Hope.” “My message is, I want to treat you like I want to be treated,” Ms. McEntire said. “It’s the golden rule. I think if we did that more often, a lot of these problems would be nonexistent. Let’s just treat people kindly.” Lisa Loeb, who won best children’s album, said, only half in jest: “I know some people are saying the music industry took a little while to catch up with some of the other industries. But we haven’t had as many awards ceremonies.” Hours before the show began, it already had a Trump controversy. On Saturday night, CNN aired an interview with Jay-Z as part of the inaugural episode of “The Van Jones Show,” in which Jay-Z commented on the president’s reported denigration of Haiti and African countries. “It is disappointing and it’s hurtful,” Jay-Z said. “Because it’s looking down at a whole population of people and it’s so misinformed because these places have beautiful people and beautiful everything. This is the leader of the free world speaking like this.” By 8:18 a.m. Sunday, the president fired off his response on Twitter. A little more than an hour later, Mr. Jones — who is managed by Jay-Z’s company, Roc Nation — wrote on Twitter in response, noting that he did ask Jay-Z about the president’s record on reducing black unemployment, and Jay-Z responded that the issue was about treating people with respect and not, as he put it: “Treat me really bad and pay me well.” Some of the stars at the preshow ceremony seized the opportunity to make political or personal statements. Residente, a Puerto Rican rapper who founded the influential group Calle 13, won best Latin rock album (for “Residente”). Dedicating his prize “to my country, Puerto Rico,” he spoke about the need to seek out reliable sources of news about the island. “What’s happening in Puerto Rico is horrible,” he said. “We’ve been without electricity for six months now. Some people are dying because they are not eating well. All of that, I had it in my heart when I won this a moment ago.” Cécile McLorin Salvant, a Haitian-American singer who won best jazz vocal album, addressed President Trump’s comments about Haiti and Africa. “At some points you have to either laugh or cry,” she said. “I choose to laugh.” The political material was also played for laughs. In one segment, Mr. Corden had celebrities audition for the job of reading the audiobook of Michael Wolff’s “Fire & Fury,” the much talked about look inside the Trump White House. John Legend, Cher, Snoop Dogg and Cardi B — a Bronx-born former stripper who has instantly become one of the music industry’s most beloved figures — all incredulously read excerpts aloud. The winning reader turned out to be Hillary Clinton. The bit drew laughs throughout the arena, but not everyone was pleased. “I have always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it,” Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter. “Don’t ruin great music with trash. Some of us love music without the politics thrown in it.” For a year that saw the losses of Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Tom Petty, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, Malcolm Young of AC/DC and Walter Becker of Steely Dan, there were several tributes. After the annual “in memoriam” montage, the rapper Logic, in a hoodie with “You are not alone” on the back, performed his “1-800-273-8255,” whose title is the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. As on the recording, he was joined by Ms. Cara and Khalid. Some also happened out of sight of the cameras. After a 40th anniversary edition of the Voyager Golden Record — the gold discs sent into space containing the sounds of the earth, including Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode” — won best box set package, Lawrence Azerrad, one of the album’s art directors, commented on the everlasting life of Berry’s music. “Long after the earth is gone, swallowed up by the sun,” he said, “Chuck Berry’s record will still be floating in space.” While many stars will pack the stage, the Grammys were also notable for who wasn’t there. Besides Mr. Sheeran, neither Taylor Swift nor Justin Bieber were in attendance. Jay-Z and Lorde were in the audience but did not perform. Scheduling, limitations of time and space, and the whims of performers and producers may well account for many of these absences. But in recent years, the Grammys have also faced boycotts from some artists who feel that not enough of the top prizes go to black artists. Frank Ocean stated that in regards to last year’s show. And while Drake has said that the reason he is not performing is that the Grammys asked him to cancel one of his own shows to appear, he also did not submit his latest “playlist” album, “More Life,” for award consideration. The Grammys were being held in New York for the first time since 2003, when the city was still struggling to attract business and tourism after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The New York mayor’s office lobbied hard to bring the awards back. But aside from a handful of segments with heavy-handed New York themes, the broadcast seemed little different from its recent ones at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. In one, James Corden, the host, brought Sting and the reggae singer Shaggy into the subway for a vaudevillian version of Mr. Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke,” with tough New Yorkers telling the three men to shut up or, after taking out earbuds, waving them away with “Sorry, I don’t have any cash on me.” Bruno Mars and Cardi B sang Mr. Mars’s “Finesse” as a costumed nod to 1980s hip-hop, with b-boy outfits and moves that seemed pulled from the Rosie Perez book of choreography. Later in the show was a reverent tribute to the musical traditions of Broadway, with Ben Platt from “Dear Evan Hansen” singing Leonard Bernstein’s “Somewhere” from “West Side Story,” accompanied on a dark platform by cello and acoustic guitar, his voice filling Madison Square Garden at the song’s climax. (Earlier in the day, “Dear Evan Hansen” won best musical theater album.) And Patti LuPone, backed up by an orchestra and with a full set behind her, sang “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina” from “Evita,” a reprise of her performance from the Grammys in 1981, when that show won best cast show album.","• Bruno Mars swept the top categories, winning album, record and song of the year. • Our writers and critics weigh in on the best and worst moments of the Grammys.","• Bruno Mars swept the top categories, winning album, record and song of the year. • Our writers and critics weigh in on the best and worst moments of the Grammys. . • Read more about this year’s Grammy Awards here. The Grammys were a night for old-school music to shine — but not always as expected. In an awards show that seemed at times like it was trying too hard to be “relevant,” many of its biggest winners had little or no connection with contemporary pop culture. And when they did connect, it wasn’t necessarily how you might have predicted: For example, Adele won three trophies Sunday evening (including one for her new single, “Hello”), while Beyoncé went home empty handed after being nominated six times. Still, there were plenty of memorable performances by artists who are very much part of today’s musical landscape. One such artist is Rihanna, whose performance of “Kiss It Better” from her latest No. 1 hit album, “Anti,” showed off both her vocal prowess and her sartorial style. But perhaps most surprisingly, she also brought out a guest star: Drake, who performed his own recent chart-topper, “Hotline Bling.” Other highlights included Kendrick Lamar’s fiery rendition of “The Blacker the Berry”; Lady Gaga’s emotional tribute to David Bowie; and Justin Timberlake’s high-energy medley of hits spanning two decades. Here are some other takeaways from the ceremony, which took place live from Los Angeles and was hosted by James Corden. Best New Artist Nominees Were All Over the Map This category has been a reliable source of controversial snubs over the years. Last time around, the Recording Academy left off Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and Iggy Azalea despite their popularity among fans and industry insiders alike. This year, the nomination committee didn’t disappoint. Instead of selecting an obvious frontrunner like Meghan Trainor, who dominated airplay charts last summer, the group chose five acts who all have something different going for them: Tori Kelly, Courtney Barnett, James Bay, Sam Hunt and Meg Mac. Mr. Corden even tried to make light of the situation during his opening monologue, saying he wanted to give each performer equal stage time because “we don’t want any of these kids coming back next year complaining about how they got screwed.” Alas, the joke fell flat. Ms. Kelly ended up taking home the award, but only after losing to Ms. McCallum in the first round of voting. (Ms. Kelly later returned to accept the honor.) At least the winner had a great speech prepared if she hadn’t taken home the prize. After thanking God, her family and friends, she said, “I just want to say I love my parents so much for believing in me.” Then she added: “This is so crazy! My mom used to tell me growing up ‘You can do anything.’ So, mama, look what I did!” Taylor Swift Fell Short Again Even though she made history earlier this month by becoming the youngest person ever to win Album of the Year twice, Miss Swift still couldn’t get enough recognition from the Recording Academy. Her critically acclaimed release, “1989,” failed to earn nominations in four major categories — including Record of the Year and Song of the Year — despite generating several radio smashes and reaching platinum status within weeks of its release. Perhaps the Recording Academy should consider giving her another shot? Or maybe it will go ahead and hand the title to someone else entirely. That happened once before, when Eminem became the first hip-hop act to receive the big prize in 2000. He lost again the following year. Bruno Mars Was King of Pop While the Grammys often feel like a battle between rap and rock, this year’s honoree for the prestigious Producer of the Year Award was decidedly uncontroversial. Mark Ronson beat out Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Jeff Bhasker and Sham Pooja to claim the honor, thanks largely to his work with Mr. Mars, who released two albums in 2015 alone. Mr. Mars’s triumphant return to the spotlight began with “Uptown Funk,” a collaboration with Mr. Ronson and producer Nicky Romero. Released late last fall, the track quickly climbed Billboard’s Hot 100 list, eventually peaking at No. 3 on the singles chart. Later came “Golden Skies,” a solo song featuring Miguel that reached No. 46 on the same ranking. in May of last year, and “The Hills (From Where You Are),” which hit No. 50 when it was released as part of her soundtrack for the movie The Twilight Saga: New Moon in November. Ms. Perry’s latest single is “Wildfire.” Her album has not been announced yet; she said only that its release would be timed with the tour dates. She will also perform songs from her other projects — including the 2010 film Eat Pray Love, based on Elizabeth Gilbert’s memoir about traveling to Italy, India and Indonesia after getting divorced — during the shows. In an interview, Ms. Perry described herself as someone who had always felt more comfortable performing than recording music. But even though she has spent much time in studios over the years working on albums like Teenage Dream, her most recent full-length effort, Prism, did not come together until recently. “I feel very lucky because I have this opportunity now where I can do both things,” she said. “And they are so different. They require two totally separate skill sets. So if you love one thing but hate doing another, then maybe it’s just not your path.” Ms. Perry began writing material for what became Prism while making the video for “Roar,” the first single off the album. That song, which features a chorus of roaring lions, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 list in September. It remained there for four weeks before being displaced by Pharrell Williams’s ubiquitous “Happy.” In October, Ms. Perry performed “Roar” at the American Music Awards, where she won favorite pop/rock female artist. Last weekend, she sang the song again at the Grammy Nominations Concert Live! special broadcast on CBS. On Tuesday night, she appeared alongside Mr. Williams at the MusiCares Person of the Year gala honoring Bruce Springsteen, singing his classic “Dancing in the Dark.” When asked why she chose to sing such a well known tune rather than one of hers, Ms. Perry laughed and explained that Mr. Springsteen had written the song specifically for her performance. “He wrote me into ‘Dark,’ ” she said. “That’s how he wanted us to end our set tonight.” Ms. Perry, whose parents were born in Australia, grew up listening to Australian rock bands like AC/DC and Cold Chisel. After moving to Los Angeles from Melbourne at age 17, she studied acting under Stella Adler and started taking voice lessons. By the early 2000s, she had begun releasing dance records through labels owned by L.A. Reid, the former chairman of Epic Records and current executive vice president of Island Def Jam Music Group. Among those releases were the single “Lionheart” and her debut studio album, One of the Boys, which featured collaborators like Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. A decade later, Ms. Perry remains best known for her work outside the realm of traditional pop music. But she does not consider herself a genre-defying artist. Rather, she says, she likes to think of herself as simply a singer. And right now, she wants nothing more than to share her newfound vocal skills live. “I’ve never really done any kind of concert tour or anything like that,” she said. “So my goal is to make sure people get to see all these parts of myself that haven’t necessarily gotten out there yet. Because we don’t know each other.",LLaMa2,True,
30,"URBANDALE, Iowa — One endured a childhood without running water, another spent his youth toiling over a McDonald’s grill and yet another is the son of a man who came to America with money sewn in his underwear. You would be forgiven if you mistook the initial introductions of the 2016 presidential candidates for latter-day, and somewhat clichéd, versions of a Horatio Alger story. The current White House hopefuls appear eager to outdo one another in recounting their up-from-poverty biographies, even if it means reaching back more than one generation. Candidates have sought to highlight their hardscrabble roots since the republic was young. Robert Strauss, the former Democratic chairman who died last year, once said every politician wants every voter to believe he was born in a log cabin he built himself. Yet as members of this group of presidential aspirants travel the circuit of banquets and forums, they seem intent on also claiming credit for chopping down the tree that supplied the logs. That is in large part because in addition to featuring the son of a cotton farmer, the son of a small-town minister and the granddaughter of a factory worker, the 2016 field includes the son and brother of a president whose grandfather was a senator. As Jeb Bush stockpiles money and attracts early support, largely because of his family name, his potential adversaries are seeking to differentiate themselves by all but stating explicitly that they are no senator’s grandson. “Unlike some out there, I didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family,” Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, told a group of religious broadcasters last month. Mr. Walker, whose father was a Baptist minister, may be the least subtle about it. But nearly all the candidates are introducing, or reintroducing, themselves to voters in ways that shine a light on Mr. Bush’s privileged origins. Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, was reared on a cotton farm in a house without running water. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, had the father who arrived in the United States with cash in his underwear, and Mr. Walker spent some of his teenage years laboring under the golden arches. “Listen, my dad put himself through college at night. He worked at an ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey, to put himself through college at night after he came back from the Army, and the next generation his son is the governor of the state of New Jersey,” Gov. Chris Christie said at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month. Not to be outdone, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told CPAC about his parents’ emigration from Cuba and the sacrifices they made for their children. “They had little money, no connections, quite frankly barely spoke the language and had a very limited education,” said Mr. Rubio. But the stories are not confined to the likely Republican field. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the all-but-announced Democratic candidate, used a speech last week to recount a family history that could have come from the pages of a Theodore Dreiser novel. “I’m like so many of you in this room and others whom I’ve met across this country,” Mrs. Clinton told Emily’s List, a Democratic women’s group. “My grandfather was a factory worker, started at the age of 11, worked until he was 65 and got to retire. His son, my father, went to college, was a small-business man who worked really hard and made a good life for us. My mother had a terrible, abusive childhood, had to leave at the age of 14 to go to work in order to support herself, having been abandoned by both her parents and her paternal grandparents.” If Mrs. Clinton would like to portray herself as far removed from the Goldman Sachs boardrooms and East Hampton beaches that some in her own party have tried to brand her with, Republicans feel even more urgency to connect to the electorate. For the Republicans, there is a tactical reason to contrast themselves with Mr. Bush, but the need to portray themselves as average Americans is even more fundamental. The last two Republican presidential nominees, each wealthy, lost in part because voters did not believe the candidates could relate to their struggles. Mitt Romney was savaged by Democrats for his tendency to affirm many rich-guy stereotypes, short of using “summer” as a verb. When Mr. Romney briefly considered a third presidential bid this year, Republicans pointed to what they saw as the most damning statistic from the 2012 exit polls: Among voters who said the candidate quality that most mattered to them was “cares about people like me,” President Obama won 81 percent to Mr. Romney’s 18 percent. “It has a lot to do with Romney and the disastrous campaign last time,” said Dave Carney, a Republican strategist, adding that Mr. Romney was for much of the 2012 campaign reluctant to show a more human side. The Everyman strategy is being employed this cycle in part because Republicans generally poll worse than Democrats on questions about who can better relate to voters, and because of the likely prospect of facing Mrs. Clinton in the general election. Mrs. Clinton has her own vulnerabilities, such as those $300,000 speeches and the fact that she has not driven a car for nearly a quarter-century. As the other potential Republican candidates sketch their only-in-America story, what is Mr. Bush left to say? John Kerry in 2004 leaned on his naval service in Vietnam and George W. Bush recalled his overcoming a fondness for beer, bourbon and B & B to connect to Americans with similar experiences. But Jeb Bush did not serve in the military and had no bouts with the bottle. What Mr. Bush does have, Mr. Carney noted, is a life story similar to that of his father, who had children young and left his parents’ East Coast preserve for a new life in the oil patch. “Forty-one went to West Texas in a Studebaker kicking up dust,” Mr. Carney said of the first President George Bush, for whom he worked. As Mr. Bush touched down here in suburban Des Moines on Friday for his first event in Iowa as a likely presidential candidate, hints of some forthcoming made-for-campaign biography could be heard. “I fell head over heels in love with this young, beautiful girl from León, Guanajuato, Mexico, and it kind of changed my life,” Mr. Bush said of meeting his wife when he was 17. He added: “My life can be divided between B.C. and A.C., Before Columba and After Columba.” Then, echoing his father, he explained how he had set out on his own. “We got married quickly, we had two kids, we lived in Venezuela, working for a bank,” he said. It had the all the makings of an eventual TV spot — at least until he got to the part about the bank.","URBANDALE, Iowa — One endured a childhood without running water, another spent his youth toiling over a McDonald’s grill and yet another is the son of a man who came to America with money sewn in his underwear.

You would be forgiven if you mistook the initial introductions of the 2016 presidential candidates for latter-day, and somewhat clichéd, versions of a Horatio Alger story.. But they are not. The first time Donald J. Trump spoke on stage at Liberty University last year was, as he put it, “like being back home.” He has since made similar comments about other parts of the country. And in an interview this week with The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Trump said that he had never seen anything like what happened when Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey invited him to speak at a Republican conference here. Mr. Christie, a former prosecutor, told reporters that he had been surprised by Mr. Trump’s request to come speak because he had not heard from him in months. “I didn’t know where he was,” Mr. Christie said. “He called me up and we talked for a while. I thought: Well, maybe he’s got something coming. We haven’t spoken for a long time.” In the years since then, Mr. Trump has become more outspoken than ever before in public life. On Thursday, he will host a rally in Cedar Rapids, which hosts one of the largest gatherings of evangelical Christians in the United States. At the same time, he has continued to make statements that have often been taken out of context or mischaracterized, including saying that Hillary Clinton was a “nasty woman” during a 2012 campaign stop in South Carolina. When asked about that remark at a news conference earlier this month, Mr. Trump said he meant no disrespect. “That’s not what I said,” he said. “I said she wasn’t very nice, but I don’t want to go into the details.” But after reviewing hundreds of interviews with people close to Mr. Trump, many of whom were interviewed under oath, I found that there is little doubt that he is still struggling to find his footing. His most recent remarks suggest that he is still trying to gain traction. For example, he recently said that he did not believe President Obama was born outside the United States. Now, he says, he does. But he also says things that seem to contradict himself, such as describing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas as having “a great smile” and suggesting that Mrs. Clinton should have won the popular vote. What is clear is that he still needs to find his way. It seems likely that he will continue to struggle until he finds some semblance of clarity, though whether that comes in the form of a speech delivered by someone else remains to be seen. He has said in the past that he likes to listen to music, and he has played several records recently, including Bob Marley’s 1978 song “We Will Rock You.” But he has also said he listens to rap music, particularly Eminem’s “The Slim Shady LP” (which features lyrics about sex). He has said he once read books by authors whose names start with A, B, C, D or E. He has even said he likes reading poetry. Yet he has also said he does not read enough, and that he does not know how to play piano. So far, he has said that he is “not very good at golf,” although he has shown that he can hit a ball into a hole. He has also said he likes playing cards, and has shown that he can play cribbage. He has said he has trouble walking, and has shown that he can walk well enough to get through a grocery store line. He has said he likes watching TV, and has shown that he can watch television well enough to understand what is going on. He has said he has difficulty making decisions, and has shown that he understands how to make them. He has said he wants to travel, and has shown that he can travel well enough to take a bus. He has said he likes movies, and has shown that he can enjoy them. He has said he enjoys sports, and has shown that he can enjoy them. And he has said he likes to listen to music, and has shown that he can listen to music well enough to understand what is going on. Yet he has also said he cannot drive a car, and has said he cannot ride a horse. He has said he has trouble with math, and has shown that he can do basic math. He has said he cannot write, and has shown that he can write well enough to write a newspaper article. He has said he does not understand why others think he is stupid, and has shown that he can understand what others mean by that. He has said he does not have a sense of humor, and has shown that he can be funny. He has said he has trouble sleeping, and has shown that he can sleep better if he tries. He has said he likes to eat ice cream, and has shown that he can eat ice cream well enough for it to be good. And most important of all: he has said that his favorite color is blue. That’s about the extent of his personality on this issue, but there are many more examples. In fact, when asked in an interview last year whether Mr. Trump was “a racist,” Mr. Trump replied, “I don’t know what you call people who hate other races. I am not a racist.” What Mr. Trump means by “racist” is unclear, though the term is often used as a pejorative insult. But in interviews with The New York Times, Mr. Trump has made clear that he thinks race relations are at their worst since slavery. He says blacks should not vote because they are too violent or because they do not want black men to succeed. He also believes that African-Americans should not vote because they have so much power in society. “If you look at African-American history,” he told NBC News recently, “you will see that they were never really given any real opportunities. They had very little opportunity, and now we have taken advantage of them.” But even some of those remarks seem like a stretch. Mr. Trump has said he would not say that whites have too much power, nor that blacks have too much power. So how could he have been referring to blacks? Or Hispanics? Or Asians? He might have meant all three groups. His comments may also be a way of saying he has no idea what the proper terminology is for describing black people. It is true that he has said he doesn’t believe blacks are all bad and whites are all good. But he has also said, “I have a lot of problems with certain kinds of people,” including Mexicans, Muslims, Jews, Haitians, Africans and Japanese Americans. Mr. Trump did not use the word “racist” in an interview last year with CNN. In an email interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, he said, “It’s one of those words I just don’t know how to explain.” He added, “I am not a racist.” Some Republicans argue that Mr. Trump is simply using the phrase “the N word,” which he has called out as problematic. But critics say that he is also making racially charged statements — sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. For example, Mr. Trump has suggested that white women are less likely than black women to get abortions. Black women make up only 2 percent of the population, according to census data. Yet he has called black women “dog lovers” and “crazed animals.” On another occasion, he said, “The reason why blacks are so angry is they have such low self-esteem.” He has also said that blacks are “so dumb” and “have such big heads.” Those comments were part of a series of inflammatory posts Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana. But Mr. Trump has also used racial slurs himself. In 2005, he tweeted that George W. Bush was a “fascist.” When President Obama visited South Carolina last summer, Mr. Trump said he wanted him to take back the state from Gov. Nikki Haley, whom he had appointed as ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Haley later apologized, but she still faced criticism from conservatives, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who accused her of trying to undermine the president’s policies. Mr. Trump has also said that Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be secretary of state. He has said that Barack Obama is not a legitimate president. He has questioned the legitimacy of the election results in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. He has referred to Haiti as “shithole country” and Mexico as “rapists” and “killers.” He has said he cannot wait until a Democrat becomes president. Mr. Trump has said he does not care who wins the White House, as long as he gets his wall built. In recent weeks, he has said that he wants to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, as well as a barrier along the Mexican border. He has also said that he does not mind paying for it. Mr. Trump has said that he does not pay taxes, and that his companies pay taxes.",GPT-NEO,True,
31,"Hundreds of Google employees, upset at the company’s decision to secretly build a censored version of its search engine for China, have signed a letter demanding more transparency to understand the ethical consequences of their work. In the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, employees wrote that the project and Google’s apparent willingness to abide by China’s censorship requirements “raise urgent moral and ethical issues.” They added, “Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment.” The letter is circulating on Google’s internal communication systems and is signed by about 1,400 employees, according to three people familiar with the document, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The internal activism presents another obstacle for Google’s potential return to China eight years after the company publicly withdrew from the country in protest of censorship and government hacking. China has the world’s largest internet audience but has frustrated American tech giants with content restrictions or outright blockages of services including Facebook and Instagram. It is also the latest example of how Google’s outspoken work force has agitated for changes to strategy. In April, the internet company’s employees spoke out against its involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to improve weaponry. By June, Google had said it would not renew a contract with the Pentagon for A.I. work. Google’s interest in bringing search back to China came to the forefront earlier this month, when reports surfaced that the company was working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing. The project, known internally as Dragonfly, was developed largely in secret, prompting outrage among employees who worried they had been unwittingly working on technology that would help China withhold information from its citizens. “We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we’re building,” the letter said. The letter also called on Google to allow employees to participate in ethical reviews of the company’s products, to appoint external representatives to ensure transparency and to publish an ethical assessment of controversial projects. The document referred to the situation as a code yellow, a process used in engineering to address critical problems that impact several teams. Google declined to comment on the letter. It has said in the past that it will not comment on Dragonfly or “speculation about future plans.” Late on Thursday, employees pressed Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and other management about Dragonfly at a weekly staff meeting. As of late Wednesday, one of the top questions on an internal software system called Dory, which lets employees vote for the queries that executives should answer at the meeting, asked whether Google had lost its ethical compass, said people who had reviewed the questions. Other questions on Dory asked directly about the Dragonfly project and specific information that may be censored by the Chinese government, such as air pollution data. “If we were to do our mission well, we are to think seriously about how to do more in China,” Mr. Pichai said in the staff meeting, audio of which was obtained by The Times. “That said, we are not close to launching a search product in China.” Mr. Pichai and Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, stopped answering questions about Dragonfly after seeing their answers posted on Twitter. This week’s staff meeting was the first opportunity for Google’s work force to ask executives about Dragonfly, because the meeting was not held last week. The absence of a gathering — the result of a regularly scheduled break in the summer, according to a company spokesman, Rob Shilkin — led to fears among employees that leadership was becoming less transparent following several controversies over Google’s government work. Google has traditionally been more responsive to employee concerns and more transparent about future projects and inner workings than other major technology companies, inviting questions from workers at its staff meetings and encouraging internal debate. The internal dissent over Dragonfly comes on the heels of the employee protests over Google’s involvement in the Pentagon project to use artificial intelligence. After Google said it would not renew its contract with the Pentagon, it unveiled a series of ethical principles governing its use of A.I. In those principles, Google publicly committed to use A.I. only in “socially beneficial” ways that would not cause harm and promised to develop its capabilities in accordance with human rights law. Some employees have raised concerns that helping China suppress the free flow of information would violate these new principles. In 2010, Google said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company’s corporate infrastructure in an attempt to access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. The attack, combined with government censorship, propelled Google to pull its search engine from the country. The exit from China was a seminal moment for the company — a symbol of its uncompromising idealism captured by Google’s unofficial motto of “Don’t Be Evil.” At the time, Chinese internet users marked the loss of Google’s search engine by laying flowers at the company’s Beijing offices in what became known as an “illegal flower tribute.” A possible re-entry to China, according to current and former employees, is a sign of a more mature and pragmatic company. Google has maintained a significant presence in China even though its flagship services are not accessible in the country. Last year, Google announced plans for a research center in China focused on artificial intelligence. And it has introduced translation and file management apps for the Chinese market. Google now has more than 700 employees in China. Google’s work on Dragonfly is not a guarantee that its search engine will be welcomed back to China. The government would have to approve its return and it has kept American technology firms like Facebook at arm’s length, opting instead to work closely with homegrown internet behemoths. Some employees are in favor of re-entering China, arguing that exiting the country in protest of censorship has done little to pressure Beijing to change its position while it has made Google nonessential among the world’s largest base of internet users. When Google pulled out of China in 2010, Mr. Brin said it objected to the country’s “totalitarian” policies when it came to censorship, political speech and internet communications. If anything, China has only tightened its controls in the last eight years — leaving the company in a bind for how to justify its return. “You can never satisfy a censor, particularly the ones in China,” said Charles Mok, member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council who advocates and represents the information technology sector and who is affiliated with the territory’s democratic camp. Google is probably facing intense pressure to introduce more of its products in China, Mr. Mok said, but added that the company would lend legitimacy to government censorship if it debuted a censored search product in China. “Then the Chinese government can say, ‘Google is O.K. with it, too,’” he said.","Hundreds of Google employees, upset at the company’s decision to secretly build a censored version of its search engine for China, have signed a letter demanding more transparency to understand the ethical consequences of their work.

It comes as many other tech companies are facing questions over whether they violated human rights in censoring Chinese Internet sites. A recent report from Amnesty International said Google had been accused of using its power to censor politically sensitive content to profit off users. In an email interview, Mr. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, denied any link between his company’s actions and those accusations. He also said he did not know why some employees were angry. “We don’t believe there has ever been a single instance where we have taken action against any individual employee or group of employees based on political views,” he said. But the letter suggests otherwise: While it does not name specific individuals, it accuses executives of being part of what critics call a culture of silence around speech critical of government policies. Some of the signers — including several former top engineers — say that they felt pressured into signing because of their concerns about the Chinese government’s treatment of dissidents. Others say they signed the letter out of frustration with a lack of transparency surrounding the project. Several prominent Google employees have spoken up since the controversy began last year, saying that the company should be more transparent about how it works with governments overseas. One engineer, Anthony Levandowski, left Google last year after allegations surfaced that he sexually harassed female subordinates. Another engineer, Eric Chien, quit Google last month after receiving death threats. Both men said they regretted leaving the company. The letter goes further than most employees’ public statements, raising serious questions about the ethics of the way Google conducts business. Many of the signers acknowledge that the project was built without approval from the U.S. State Department, but argue that it would never have happened if the government had approved it. The project was started in 2014, when Sergey Brin, then Google’s chief operating officer, told colleagues that he wanted to start building an international search engine for China, one that could be used to bypass censorship restrictions. At first, the plan seemed like a good idea: Build a homegrown alternative to Microsoft Bing, which was blocked in mainland China. But the team soon found itself struggling to get all the necessary approvals to begin construction, which included obtaining permission from local authorities. When officials finally gave their blessing, Google hired hundreds of workers to help finish the project, even though the site was still undergoing legal review. As the project continued to grow, so did concern over what appeared to be a growing rift between the United States and China over free expression. After the original announcement of the project in February 2015, the White House called it a “significant step forward” toward promoting democracy in China. But the project quickly became mired in controversy. On March 15, 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had begun censoring its results in China, effectively shutting down access to some sites. Two days later, the newspaper published another article about the project, this time describing how Google had forced employees to turn away visitors from certain websites. Soon afterward, Google announced that it would no longer allow anyone outside China to use the service. Now, the company says it wants to share more information about its activities. Last week, a group of 20 prominent technology leaders and scholars issued a statement condemning the project, calling it a violation of both American values and basic principles of freedom of speech. And earlier this month, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Democratic presidential nominee, called on Google to stop censoring Chinese Internet services. “I think it’s wrong that we are doing this,” Mr. Sanders said during an appearance on MSNBC. “This is something I think we need to look at very seriously, and I hope that the company will take steps to ensure that we can continue to have access to these tools.” The letter appears to echo similar calls made last summer by Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents exposing widespread surveillance by the agency. That leak prompted the Obama administration to impose sanctions on Google, requiring it to change its practices. Since then, the company has faced criticism from lawmakers, civil liberties groups and others concerned about the impact of its work in China. But critics say the letter is symptomatic of broader problems within Silicon Valley, especially in areas such as privacy, intellectual property and corporate responsibility. They point to the high-profile cases involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, two data mining firms that were acquired by Facebook before the release of the NSA’s trove of classified documents. Those deals raised new questions about whether Facebook and other social media platforms should be held responsible for the behavior of third parties. And they highlighted the tension between the tech industry’s desire to avoid negative publicity and the demands of regulators and politicians. For example, Facebook recently agreed to pay $5 billion to settle charges that it misled investors about privacy risks posed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It also paid a record fine last year for failing to disclose that one of its chief executives had been secretly recorded speaking with Russian officials. The settlement does not address how Facebook handled or responded to those recordings — which surfaced after news reports revealed their existence — nor did it resolve the question of what Facebook knew about them. “The reality is that we have an enormous amount of information that was collected in this country,” said David Zalesne, who led Facebook until 2012. “And there are so many people who don’t know where it came from, because they didn’t want to know.” That includes the government agencies that collect most of the personal data on American citizens: Social Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has long resisted calls for him to reveal more details about his company, including how much revenue he makes each quarter. He has argued instead that he needs to protect users’ private data. And he has refused requests by lawmakers, the public and others to make his business more transparent. Some lawmakers have suggested that the disclosures made by Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency, may help explain why Facebook chose not to share more information about itself. But Mr. Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea, saying that he would rather focus on building products that people love. “I think the best way to do that is to build something that you care about,” he told CNN recently. “We need to figure out how to make our product better than anyone else’s, and then figure out ways to do that.” At a time when technology companies are under intense scrutiny over leaks and revelations of questionable practices, some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley seem eager to keep quiet. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, declined to comment on the issue but did not deny that he had received a copy of the report. “We have no reason to believe that any of our systems are vulnerable to surveillance or hacking,” he wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “In fact, we encourage all of you to use encryption wherever possible.” Others at Facebook, like Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, and Robert A. Iger, Facebook’s president, have repeatedly insisted that the company is in good standing with the government. On Wednesday, Ms. Sandberg, a Harvard graduate, appeared on CNBC to defend her role in helping create Facebook. She said she had never met Mr. Snowden and had no knowledge of his activities. “We do not discuss individual employees’ privacy issues,” she said. “We do not discuss individuals’ privacy rights, nor do we discuss the collection or misuse of personal information. We do not discuss the balance of power between governments and corporations.” And while Mr. Iger, the executive vice chairman, has said he knows nothing about the Cambridge Analytica case, he has gone further, describing himself as a libertarian. “You can’t tell me what to do with my own life without knowing my history,” he said in an interview. “I am very open with the world. I am very open with the rest of the world.” Mr. Zuckerberg said he had received a copy of the report from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. “I am not going to answer any questions about this matter,” he said. “This is about protecting people’s right to privacy.” Many Silicon Valley leaders, though, see the controversy as another manifestation of the growing conflict between the tech industry and Congress over regulation of big tech. After years of bipartisan support for tougher regulations, the debate has intensified since President Obama took office, with Republicans demanding stronger oversight. Last week, lawmakers proposed sweeping changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, making it less likely that the court will approve surveillance warrants. Democrats are also considering legislation that could require companies to disclose more about how they handle customer data.",GPT-NEO,True,
32,"Raising the prospect of lasting fissures in the party, Senator Bernie Sanders rebuffed pressure on Tuesday to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada, throwing chairs and later threatening the state chairwoman in a fight over delegates. The uproar comes as Hillary Clinton is struggling to turn her and the party’s attention to the fall. Mr. Sanders’s supporters showed no sign of backing down on Tuesday. In interviews, several threatened to disrupt the party’s convention in Philadelphia in July with protests and nonviolent disobedience over a nominating system that they say has treated Mr. Sanders unfairly. In emails, on social media and on websites, his supporters have traded advice about protest tactics and legal services in case of mass arrests. Alarmed by the unrest in Nevada, Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, said that he spoke with Mr. Sanders on Tuesday and that the Vermont senator faced a “test of leadership” over his supporters’ actions. Mr. Reid, who represents Nevada, said he was confident that Mr. Sanders would “do the right thing.” But Mr. Sanders showed no sign of backing down, releasing a statement that, while condemning violence, accused the Democratic leadership in Nevada of using “its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place.” The fight in Nevada underscored the determination of Mr. Sanders’s supporters to undermine Mrs. Clinton’s all-but-certain march to the nomination. On Tuesday she lost the Oregon primary but declared victory in Kentucky, where she held a 1,900-vote edge according to complete but unofficial returns. Mrs. Clinton spent Monday campaigning in Kentucky, showing how the battle against Mr. Sanders continues to distract her campaign even as she turns her fire on Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. And leading Democrats have become increasingly vocal about the need to unify the party for the general election — while being careful not to anger Mr. Sanders by urging him to quit the race. Senator Barbara Boxer of California said she had reached out to Mr. Sanders about the need for unity. “I have placed a couple of calls to Bernie,” Ms. Boxer said. “He’s my friend. He’s been my friend for many, many, many years, and I haven’t heard back from Bernie, and I would hope that Bernie will be a leader and make sure that everybody understands what is at stake. And what is at stake is the future of our nation. Nothing less.” Ms. Boxer, who was in Nevada for the convention on Saturday as Sanders supporters erupted in anger, called what she witnessed ”terrible.” “We just can’t have a repeat of that in Philadelphia because it’s distressing,” Ms. Boxer said. “I have a message to the Bernie people who are planning to be disobedient because the system is rigged. Here is the thing: They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most votes. They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most delegates. There is nothing to protest.” But Sanders supporters remained defiant, raising the possibility of unrest on the streets outside the convention. “You are going to see a variety of tactics,” said Elizabeth Arnold, 32, a former staff member for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia who said she planned to demonstrate. “I personally don’t like being arrested. But it’s essential that we speak our minds and assert our First Amendment rights. Our system is terribly flawed and terribly unjust — so very just actions often end in arrests.” Ms. Arnold, who helped found EDGE, an environmental justice group based in Philadelphia, said she did not condone violence and hoped that people would find a way to voice concerns peacefully. But she said that Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic leaders attending the convention “should worry about what is going to happen.” Nina Turner, a prominent surrogate for Mr. Sanders, said that she had seen several emails from people planning acts of civil disobedience, and that talk of dissent in the Republican ranks over Mr. Trump masked the searing divisions among Democrats. “People are talking about the Republicans having a brokered convention. I think we are sleeping on the Democrats,” Ms. Turner said. “And if Democrats believe that that’s not going to happen, they are just sadly mistaken. They have blinders on.” “It is going to be progressives who will disrupt,” she said. “And when I say disrupt, I don’t mean in a violent or a terrible way, but I just mean upset the apple cart.” April Mellody, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Convention, said in a statement that the convention’s security team would work with the Philadelphia police and the Secret Service “to ensure the safety and security of all of our delegates and participants.” After the meeting of Nevada Democrats on Saturday ended in mayhem when many potential Sanders delegates were deemed ineligible, Roberta Lange, the state party chairwoman, said she had received death threats against her and her family after Sanders supporters spread her cellphone number online. “The Sanders campaign helped incite everything that happened,” she said. “Instead of attacking me, they should be publicly apologizing to me for the part that they played. I’m really disappointed. It makes me feel like it is not being taken seriously.” On Tuesday, the Nevada State Democratic Party issued a formal complaint to the Democratic National Committee in response to the behavior of Mr. Sanders’s supporters. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the national party chairwoman, also expressed her concern Tuesday. “We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas,” she said. But the protest effort enjoys some institutional support. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union that has endorsed Mr. Sanders and that has been busing its members across the country to campaign for him, also said her group planned to take part in demonstrations at the convention. “We will be a significant force inside and a significant force outside,” she said. “The focus is going to be how disenfranchised the voters felt during this election by the D.N.C.” An article on Wednesday about pressure that Democratic officials are putting on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada misidentified, in some editions, the Senate leadership job held by Harry Reid. He is the minority leader — not the majority leader, the post held by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.","Raising the prospect of lasting fissures in the party, Senator Bernie Sanders rebuffed pressure on Tuesday to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada, throwing chairs and later threatening the state chairwoman in a fight over delegates.

The uproar comes as Hillary Clinton is struggling to turn her and the party’s attention to the fall. campaign. “We have to take care of our people first,” Mr. Sanders said at an event here. He was speaking with Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, who has been critical of Mr. Sanders, but not hostile. “I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what happened tonight,” he said. “But I want to make sure that we all understand that this was a very small group of individuals who had no intention of disrupting anything. They were simply trying to vent their frustrations and get some good old-fashioned political action.” Mr. Sanders has long held up his visit to Las Vegas — where he delivered remarks about free college tuition and economic justice before hundreds of thousands of attendees — as evidence that he could win over disenchanted Democrats. But Mr. Sanders also made clear that he did not plan to back down from his criticism of Mrs. Clinton, saying she had failed to meet the standards of equality that he says are necessary to restore American democracy. In an interview with CNN, he also suggested that Mrs. Clinton had exaggerated the size of her lead against Donald J. Trump by several percentage points. “It’s not fair to say that she won the popular vote because there was fraud,” Mr. Sanders told the network. “The truth is, if you look at the results, they didn’t even come close.” On Monday night, Mr. Sanders called for the resignation of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, whom he accused of being part of a corrupt establishment that had rigged the system in favor of Wall Street banks and other corporations. “John Kasich should resign immediately,” Mr. Sanders said. “He’s got a conflict of interest problem.” Mr. Kasich’s office declined to comment on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Mr. Kasich said that the governor would not discuss his views publicly. Mr. Kasich, who is running for re-election in Ohio next year, has been dogged by questions about whether he has broken any laws or ethics rules while serving as governor. He has refused to answer questions from reporters, including one last week when he appeared to suggest that Mr. Sanders might have been born outside the United States. He has also repeatedly denied having received money from lobbyists or special interests. Mr. Sanders’s comments came during a contentious debate between him and Mrs. Clinton, which lasted more than four hours. Both candidates tried to draw contrasts with each other, but they often clashed over policy issues like health care, education and climate change. And both candidates accused each other of playing fast and loose with facts in order to score cheap media hits. At times, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be mocking Mr. Sanders’s proposals, such as his proposal to raise taxes on wealthy Americans. She called him out for proposing to pay for universal prekindergarten, a program that Mr. Sanders opposes. As the two engaged in the most intense exchanges yet, Mrs. Clinton struggled to find a way to break through. Her advisers acknowledged that the party was facing an unprecedented crisis: With just days left until Election Day, the Republican presidential nominee is already losing support among moderate voters, many of them white working class men and women who have turned away from Mr. Trump. Many of those voters, she conceded, will never go to the polls again. The Democratic Party’s leaders were determined to avoid a repeat of 2008, when Mrs. Clinton lost the nomination to Barack Obama. Instead, they decided to try to rebuild a party that can appeal to young voters, minorities and independents. Ms. Clinton’s team is still trying to figure out how to do that. But on Wednesday morning, the president of the United States, a Democrat, offered a stark warning to Republicans: If you don’t start paying your bills, you’ll get nothing. “You’re going to see us doing everything we can to help folks keep their homes,” Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House speaker, declared at the annual meeting of the National Association of Social Workers. “If you’re not making enough to cover basic expenses, then you’re going to lose jobs. You’re going to lose wages. We’re going to see you getting less benefits. You’re going to see us cutting back on Medicaid.” The message, delivered by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., underscored the challenge of turning around a once solidly conservative party. “It’s hard to believe that we are a decade into this century,” Mr. Biden said. “And we’ve already seen a lot of progress. There’s been huge changes in terms of the economy. It’s true that a lot of people have lost jobs but I think there has also been some real progress in terms of raising incomes for working families and it’s very important that we continue to make those gains.” The Democratic presidential candidates were quick to praise President Obama as they made their way through an hourlong debate on Thursday night at George Washington University in Virginia. They called him “the best job creator since Abraham Lincoln” and declared that he was transforming American society by making government work better. But they also acknowledged that his record was not perfect. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called the Affordable Care Act “a disaster” and vowed to dismantle it if elected president. He did not mention the name of one Republican who had voted against it. And he criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting the Iraq war, which she had opposed. “I don’t know how you can vote for someone who supported the invasion of Iraq when you know that over 60 percent of Americans do not support the war,” Mr. Sanders said. “But I will tell you what: We need a new direction.” Mr. Obama was asked about the criticism from Republicans. “The fact is, I was elected twice by two-thirds majorities of the Congress,” he said. “We cannot afford to be debating whether or not we should get rid of Obamacare.” He added, “We have got to figure out how to grow our economy without destroying it.” But Mr. Obama said the country would not be able to pay off its debt until after 2030. That was far less than many Democrats expected. In the end, he conceded that the United States could not keep paying down its debts. “Our priorities must change,” he said. “That means spending more time focused on education, health care, infrastructure and other things that really matter to people.” Mr. McCain took aim at Mrs. Clinton for her role in the 2008 election. “She played a major role in helping Barack Obama win the presidency because she knew that a Democrat was going to take control of the House next year,” he said. “Hillary Clinton does not want to raise taxes on middle class families. She wants to cut Social Security benefits for retirees. She supports free college tuition for all children.” In contrast to the attacks on Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McCain said that he wanted to see the nation’s tax code overhauled so that it would encourage investment in America’s future. “This is not just my view; it’s the view of every member of Congress,” he said. “We need to rethink what we call corporate welfare.” He added, “We need to consider the possibility that corporations might be required to share profits with workers, like farmers in Wisconsin.” Mr. Romney said the United States needed to move away from being “a global leader in the world,” adding, “The world needs to realize that if we don’t act decisively, then others will catch up to us.” “If we don’t start acting decisively, then we will find ourselves behind China and India,” he said. Mr. Trump said the United States had “turned our backs on God” and that he had told evangelical leaders that they would never again receive preferential treatment under federal law. “I said it before and I say it now — I am going to stop playing games with evangelicals,” he said. “They are losing millions of dollars, and they have no idea why.” Mr. Ryan pointed out that Mr. Obama had promised during his campaign that he would create 50 million jobs. “President Obama has failed to deliver on that promise,” he said. “He has created only 23 million jobs since taking office.” Mr. Rubio said he wanted to improve economic conditions for low-income residents. “This is not a partisan issue,” he said. “I am here today to talk about opportunity, not poverty.” Mr. Cruz said the United States had become too dependent on foreign oil, saying it had led to a “crisis of civilization.” “We are running out of options,” he said. “We are running out of ways to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.” He said that climate change posed a national security threat and that it threatened the stability of international trade agreements.",GPT-NEO,True,
33,"WASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton’s personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation. To track how the information flowed, agents will try to gain access to the email accounts of many State Department officials who worked there while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, the officials said. State Department employees apparently circulated the emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011, and some were ultimately forwarded to Mrs. Clinton. They were not marked as classified, the State Department has said, and it is unclear whether its employees knew the origin of the information. The F.B.I. is also trying to determine whether foreign powers, especially China or Russia, gained access to Mrs. Clinton’s private server, although at this point, any security breaches are speculation. Law enforcement officials have said that Mrs. Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president, is not a target of the investigation, and she has said there is no evidence that her account was hacked. There has also been no evidence that she broke the law, and many specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in her account was probably of marginal consequence. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said in a statement on Friday that she “took the handling of classified information very seriously.” “She always received classified materials in secure settings, either by phone, videoconference, on paper or in person,” said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. “If, however, some material unknowingly ended up somewhere on the State Department’s unclassified email system, we want to continue to be as helpful as possible in getting to the bottom of that.” He added: “Beyond that, we’ll let the State Department and other agencies speak to the specifics.” This week, the inspector general of the nation’s intelligence agencies, I. Charles McCullough III, informed members of Congress that Mrs. Clinton had “top secret” information, the highest classification of government intelligence, in her account. Some of that information, according to a memorandum the inspector general sent to the heads of the Senate and House intelligence and judiciary committees, may have come from a program called Talent Keyhole, which relies on satellite intercepts of conversations or imagery data. The program involves some of the most secure information in the intelligence agencies’ computer systems. Specifically, the inspector general told members of Congress that two emails should have been classified as top secret, with one of them designated “TOP SECRET//SI//TK/NOFORN.” Officials familiar with the nomenclature said that “SI” stood for “special intelligence,” usually indicating an intercepted communication, and that “TK” was routinely used as an abbreviation for Talent Keyhole, showing that the communication or an image was obtained from a satellite. Attached to the memo — which was publicly released by Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee — were copies of two of Mrs. Clinton’s emails that Mr. McCullough said contained classified information. Those emails were not released publicly. The State Department has questioned whether the determination by Mr. McCullough is correct. Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with the view of some federal officials that the State Department is not rigorous enough in handling classified national security information. In an unusual move, the F.B.I.’s inquiry is being led out of its headquarters in Washington, blocks from the White House. Nearly all investigations are assigned to one of the bureau’s 56 field offices. But given this inquiry’s importance, senior F.B.I. officials have opted to keep it closely held in Washington in the agency’s counterintelligence section, which investigates how national security secrets are handled. The investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails has its roots in her decision to use only a private email account for her official business when she was secretary of state, an unorthodox decision that gave her some control over what was made public. She faced criticism when her use of the account became known this year, and after deleting what she said were more than 31,000 personal emails, she turned over more than 30,000 work-related emails for the State Department to make public. Mrs. Clinton has said that her emails contained no classified information — having classified information outside a secure government account is illegal — and that she is fully cooperating with the investigation. But in reviewing a sampling of the emails for potential security breaches, Mr. McCullough said he found four out of 40 that contained classified information, though perhaps stripped of any indication that it was of classified origin. According to current and former State Department officials who worked with Mrs. Clinton, most classified information was routed to classified government servers in her office, where it was printed out for her review. Her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, often operated the same way. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Thursday in response to what she said were “allegations about Mrs. Clinton’s emails” that “none of the emails alleged to contain classified information were written by Secretary Clinton” and that “none of the emails alleged to contain classified information include any markings that indicate classified content.” In a letter made public on Wednesday, David Kendall, Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer, said he had handed over to the Justice Department a thumb drive containing the 30,000 emails that had been given to the State Department. He also said the company that had handled Mrs. Clinton’s personal account had given the Justice Department the server Mrs. Clinton used to operate it. The company, Platte River Networks, had been in possession of the server since 2013. Computer experts said it was likely that F.B.I. technicians would be able to recover from the server at least some of Mrs. Clinton’s deleted personal emails. In addition, specially trained cybersecurity investigators will seek to determine whether Russian, Chinese or other hackers breached the account or tried to transfer any of Mrs. Clinton’s emails, including those containing the classified information, several officials said. Mrs. Clinton’s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, told CBS News this week that “it is very likely” that Russian or Chinese hackers read his emails, although he did not specify whether he was talking about his classified or unclassified accounts. “I certainly write things with that awareness,” he said.","WASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton’s personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation.","WASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton’s personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation.. The inquiry is focused on whether Mr. Obama administration officials were complicit in providing material that was not publicly available about a covert operation by Secretary of State John Kerry. Investigators have been examining how an intelligence agency with access to top secret documents obtained the emails through a separate government program known as “electronic surveillance.” At issue is the use of those same records for the secretary of state’s personal email. If so, it would be a significant break from past practice: In recent years, most secretaries of state have used their own accounts for official correspondence, but the State Department has never had its own system for handling sensitive communications. That could pose problems if Mrs. Clinton or her aides were caught using a private account for work-related matters, like preparing speeches, meetings and other official business. It also raises questions about how much she knew about what was going on inside her network when she decided to set up the new arrangement last year. Her lawyers say they are reviewing the matter. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. But one official said that while there is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton herself authorized the use of her personal account for State Department business, it could still constitute a violation of department policy. Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. She has said she does not know why the State Department did not create a separate account for her. “It’s a serious problem,” said David M. Friedman, a former senior United States attorney for the Southern District of New York who is now an assistant professor at Columbia University School of Public Affairs. “If you don’t have your own system, then you can’t have your own security. And that’s where this becomes important, because it’s very easy to get into trouble.” In June 2014, the State Department released a report saying Mrs. Clinton’s staff had failed to properly safeguard some of the emails on her private account, which contained information related to the 2012 attack on Osama bin Laden. Some of the messages were marked “classified,” meaning that only a select group of people had access to them. Others were labeled “confidential” or “top secret” and were intended for internal use only. The State Department did not release the names of the individuals involved. The State Department and the Defense Department also did not make public the contents of the emails, even though many of the messages were marked “confidential.” Those markings were included in a list of categories called CLASSIFIED, CONFIDENTIAL or TOP SECRET, which were defined in the report. The report found that Mrs. Clinton and her aides had violated federal regulations governing the preservation of national defense secrets by failing to preserve some of the emails on her account. The rules required that all such materials be destroyed after 30 days, unless they were deemed necessary for an ongoing investigation. Mrs. Clinton has disputed that assertion. “The fact that I am being investigated for my email practices is completely false,” she told reporters at a news conference last month. “I am not under investigation. We are simply looking at whether I broke the rules.” An examination of the State Department’s electronic surveillance program, which collects data from phone calls, Internet traffic and social media posts, may shed light on the role played by the Obama administration officials who received classified information from the NSA. Officials familiar with the case said that the review of the State Department’s surveillance program began months ago, and that the government has already identified several dozen employees who had access to the material. The review was conducted by the Office of Intelligence Policy Review, led by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of National Intelligence. The review, which will be completed next week, is part of the broader effort to identify potential leakers within the executive branch. Mr. Clapper has said he believes that the leak occurred during the course of his oversight of the surveillance program. He has said that the Obama administration officials were aware of the leaks and should have acted to stop them. The review is likely to focus on the conduct of the two highest ranking members of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. They are both married to longtime associates of Mr. Obama, and they serve as deputy chief of staff to the president. Both women have served as aides to Mrs. Clinton since 2010. The review is expected to turn up additional information that might help investigators piece together what happened behind closed doors, including conversations between Ms. Abedin and the State Department. On Wednesday, Mrs. Abedin said she was not ready to discuss the case. “I’m going to wait until the end of the day to talk about it,” she said. The State Department has asked Congress for permission to declassify some of the emails, which were sent in 2013 and 2014. The State Department is also preparing a report on Benghazi that will be released publicly next week. But Ms. Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, has been reluctant to reveal her private correspondence with Mr. Obama because he had already made public his own history with Mrs. Clinton. In an interview last month, she refused to answer questions about her personal life, saying only: “I have no idea what you’re talking about. I don’t know if there are any other people involved in this.” She did say she would like to see more transparency around government investigations into the 2012 attacks on the United States diplomatic compound in Libya. Her spokesman, Nick Merrill, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said the senator would not discuss the Benghazi investigation. He also denied being told by Hillary Rodham Clinton’s staff that they could withhold information related to the attack from the House Oversight Committee investigating the matter. “The president does not want anyone to get hurt or embarrassed,” Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said at a news conference after meeting privately with Mrs. Clinton on Friday. “He doesn’t want anybody to be afraid of him.” The White House has declined requests for interviews, but officials said they expected to release their version of events as soon as Monday. On Sunday night, Mrs. Clinton held a fund-raiser for former President Bill Clinton, including a speech by one of his daughters. The event raised $1 million for charity. “I am grateful for all my friends who supported me through thick and thin,” she said. “It means so much to everyone who knew me personally and who I was close to — even when we disagreed, even when I thought it wasn’t fair, even when I didn’t think it was right. It meant everything.” Mr. Obama has repeatedly insisted that he never gave Mrs. Clinton permission to use a home telephone line to make calls to the State Department during her tenure. And he has maintained that she had no role in arranging the security for the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, who died in the attack. At least four Americans have come forward since then to describe how Mrs. Clinton, who served under both presidents, played a central role in helping secure the compound, according to two administration insiders. They described a series of meetings between Mrs. Clinton and senior aides, including Susan Rice, the national security adviser, and Sean Spicer, the press secretary, where she suggested ways to improve the security. One of those aides, Jason D. Richardson, now a top aide at the National Security Council, said in an email on Saturday that Mrs. Clinton had urged him to send messages to reporters asking them to withhold details about the episode, which occurred hours before Mr. Obama left office. “She wanted us to keep our story as simple as possible,” Mr. Richardson wrote. “We agreed and sent her the text of the message she wanted us to send.” Another official said the White House had received several complaints from members of Congress over the years about Mrs. Clinton’s handling of the Benghazi inquiry. That official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the subject. “To date, nobody has come forward to explain why Secretary Clinton chose to stay silent and allow the committee to pursue its work without having an explanation,” the official said. Mrs. Clinton has faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for her response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. She has said she believes the attacks were justified and that the U.S. should have done more to prevent them. She has also insisted that she acted alone. Mr. Obama has pointed out that he was briefed by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta about the attack, and that he met with Mrs. Clinton twice. “If she did anything wrong, it was entirely up to her,” Mr. Obama said in an interview last year. “The fact that she did something wrong is not a defense against it. If she did something wrong, she should take responsibility.” Mr. Obama has sought to distance himself from Mrs. Clinton and her husband, whom he called a “bad fit” for high office, and has defended the decision to leave the country’s embassy in Cairo after the attacks.",GPT-NEO,True,
34,"Zaida Catalán was on to something, and it was making her jumpy. “Exciting development,” she scribbled in her diary in late January. “I can maybe nail this bastard. Damn!” Weeks later, Ms. Catalán, a United Nations investigator with little training and no safety equipment or even health insurance, headed into a remote area teeming with militia fighters to find the culprits behind a massacre in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A grainy cellphone video shows what happened next: A cluster of men with rifles and red bandannas lead Ms. Catalán, a 36-year-old Swedish-Chilean, into a grove with her American colleague, Michael J. Sharp, 34. The two investigators are barefoot. Mr. Sharp starts arguing. He and Ms. Catalán are forced onto the ground. Suddenly, shots are fired, hitting Mr. Sharp first. Ms. Catalán screams and tries to run for cover. She is shot twice. Their bodies were discovered weeks later in a shallow grave, laid out carefully, side by side, in opposite directions. Ms. Catalán had been decapitated. Her head had been taken. Their deaths raise tough questions about the United Nations and its work in the most dangerous places in the world. Almost two months passed before the United Nations even assembled a panel to look into what went wrong. The United Nations Security Council could go further and order a more formal investigation, but more than two months after the murders, it has taken no steps in that direction. Instead, it has left the investigation to Congo, a nation where violence, corruption and impunity are so widespread that the United Nations has had to spend billions of dollars over the years in a failed effort to bring peace and stability. Indeed, a big focus of Ms. Catalán and her colleagues was whether the Congolese government played a role in the massacre and broader chaos she was investigating. “The U.N. needs to take ownership,” said Akshaya Kumar, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch. She added that the Congolese authorities, who are implicated in the region’s conflict, were in no position to carry out a credible investigation. The killings have also stirred a sharp debate over the United Nations’ responsibility to prepare and protect the people it hires to investigate wrongdoing around the world. Ms. Catalán and Mr. Sharp belonged to a panel of six experts authorized by the Security Council to investigate rapes, massacres and the exploitation of Congo’s vast natural resources. They traveled without United Nations escorts, often going into areas that are no-go zones for United Nations employees. In this case, the two hired three motorcycle taxis and a Congolese interpreter to ferry them into the countryside. Their Congolese companions are still missing. There is no evidence that they have been killed. As independent contractors, the investigators had no health insurance and received little training on how to operate in hostile environments. They were bound by the United Nations’ security rules; don’t travel on motorcycle taxis was one. But former investigators say United Nations officials know full well the risks that experts routinely take to do their jobs. At least two said they had asked for electronic devices to track their locations and send distress signals, in case of emergencies exactly like this. The United Nations, through a spokesman, said it was not “a feasible requirement” to provide them. “They were more looking at protecting themselves than protecting us,” said Daniel Fahey, who served on the Congo panel in 2013 and 2014. “Everyone loved our analyses. But no one really asked us: ‘How do you guys do this? What do you need?’” Frans Barnard, a former British Army officer who served on the Congo panel in 2014, said he had been concerned enough to buy his own location tracker. “In my world, duty of care means if we ask you to do something, we give you the training and the equipment to do that,” Mr. Barnard said. Asked whether the United Nations had done enough to prepare and protect the experts, José Luis Díaz, a spokesman, said the organization was asking itself the same question. “This is why the U.N. is looking at the whole sequence of events in the disappearance and murder of our colleagues,” he said in an email. “We want to assess whether things worked as they should, and if what we have in place is adequate or robust enough.” Congo has a long history of conflict and suffering. Foreign powers, successive leaders and an alphabet soup of rebel groups have all pillaged its rich natural resources. The country is the focus of the most expensive peacekeeping operation in the world. But the mission, called Monusco, has often been criticized for turning a blind eye to human rights abuses committed by government forces and rebels alike. Ms. Catalán, a former Green Party activist in Sweden who had been working as a United Nations expert for less than a year, quickly got sucked into an extraordinarily dangerous world that she was woefully unprepared for, where the line between murderous rebels and corrupt politicians often blurs. She worked assiduously to untangle a murky web of local politicians, rebel leaders and government ministers, trying to pin down perpetrators so that the Security Council could impose sanctions on them. Her tools often boiled down to a pen that doubled as a recorder, and a determined line of inquiry that ended up putting her life in danger. It is still unclear who ordered the murders of the experts. The Congolese government said it had released the cellphone video to show that militia fighters, not its soldiers, were responsible. In April, the government announced the arrests of two men. One escaped. Then, on Saturday, the Congolese said they knew who had ordered the killings and where Ms. Catalán’s head was, but gave no further details. But according to documents kept on Ms. Catalán’s computer and to others familiar with the case, she had been scrutinizing a government minister, Clément Kanku, for his possible role in inciting violence in the Congolese region of Kasai last year. Mr. Kanku, the minister of development until he was fired this month, had close links to the militia fighters in the area; he had been brought into President Joseph Kabila’s coalition government last year to bring the rebels to heel. Ms. Catalán kept 130 files in a folder on her computer under Mr. Kanku’s name. Among them was a recorded phone conversation in which he seems to discuss setting fire to a town in the region, Tshimbulu, with a subordinate. They talk about a successful jailbreak, targeted assassinations of a colonel and other officials, and general mayhem. “We burnt Tshimbulu,” the subordinate is heard saying. “It’s good that we burn everything; that is good news,” Mr. Kanku replies. “The colonel is in his house, and we’re burning down the house so he burns to death,” the subordinate says. Mr. Kanku asks: “Did you kill the colonel’s bodyguards?” “Yes, we beat his bodyguards on the head with our batons,” the subordinate responds. Though it was unclear how she had obtained it, Ms. Catalán had the recording in her possession in January, according to people familiar with her work, the same month she wrote in her diary about the big breakthrough. She had also texted Mr. Sharp, her colleague in Congo: “I have big stuff going on.” People familiar with the case said Mr. Kanku had known she had the audio file. In fact, she had told Mr. Kanku that she had it, they said, and was scheduled to discuss the matter with him after her trip into the bush. When contacted by The New York Times, Mr. Kanku initially denied, then confirmed, that he had been in contact with the experts. “I talked with the man; the woman, I didn’t talk to her.” When pressed, he replied: “I think I also spoke with the woman, but I’m not sure because many people call me.” “Listen, where are you? Can I see you?” he continued, sounding nervous. “I can’t talk right now. I’ll call you after.” Mr. Kanku abruptly hung up without addressing the contents of the tape. He did not call back or respond to multiple calls after that. It was Ms. Catalán’s sister, Elizabeth, who first raised the alarm that the United Nations investigators were in trouble. Late in the afternoon on March 12, she received an unnerving call from Ms. Catalán’s cellphone. “I couldn’t hear her voice,” she said in their family’s home in Sweden. “I just heard lots of men talking in the background, not just a few but many, a group of men talking.” Sensing something wrong, the family frantically reached out to Ms. Catalán’s colleagues in the United Nations. The United Nations said peacekeepers “sprang into action from the very start,” with troops and helicopters deployed the next morning, according to Mr. Díaz, the spokesman. The few peacekeepers stationed nearby began searching by road and air. But it took four days to deploy more United Nations forces from other parts of the country and begin a robust search, according to the commander of Monusco’s Uruguayan forces, Col. Luis Mangini. It took a full two weeks to find the bodies. The autopsy concluded little. Death by multiple injuries, it said. Ms. Catalán’s second autopsy report, conducted by a private Ugandan pathology service, said the body, initially examined by the Congolese authorities, “had neither blood staining, mud nor soiling of any sort, suggesting that the body had been washed clean.” Families and friends of Ms. Catalán said they were unaware of just how dangerous her job was, even compared with her earlier assignments. Ms. Catalán previously worked for the European Union, educating local police officers in Afghanistan, Congo and the Palestinian territories on gender-based violence. She once confided to a friend about the ad hoc nature of her United Nations assignment. It was, she said, like living on the edge. In December, during a visit home for Christmas, Ms. Catalán recounted a frightening episode in which she had interviewed a rebel leader accused of committing atrocities. “I barely made it out of that room alive,” Elizabeth, her sister, recalled her saying. The risks began to take a toll on her. A week before her death, she had a disturbing premonition: “My body will be carried out of the jungle,” she confided to a friend. Now, relatives, colleagues and friends are frustrated at the handling of the killings. The Swedish authorities say they are looking into the deaths, but family members are calling on the United Nations to conduct a credible, independent investigation as well. “What we hope for now is an independent international criminal investigation,” said Mr. Sharp’s father, John. “We can’t depend on the Congolese government to do it.”","Zaida Catalán was on to something, and it was making her jumpy. “Exciting development,” she scribbled in her diary in late January.","Zaida Catalán was on to something, and it was making her jumpy. “Exciting development,” she scribbled in her diary in late January.

35,"WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger slipped into the State Department last week for a quiet lunch in his old office with Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chief executive, who has all but covered himself in a cloak of invisibility in his first six weeks as secretary of state. Describing his impressions, Mr. Kissinger, perhaps America’s most famous diplomatic strategist, chose his words judiciously. “The normal tendency when you come into that job is to increase your visibility and to show that you are present and in charge,” he said in an interview. “He wanted to first inform himself of all the nuances. I was impressed by the confidence and self-assurance that he showed.” But in the Washington of Donald J. Trump, where foreign policy proclamations often appear first on Twitter, and where White House advisers are still battling for dominance, this approach can be seen as brilliant, mystifying or a prescription for powerlessness. Mr. Tillerson has skipped every opportunity to define his views or give guidance to American diplomats abroad, limiting himself to terse, scripted statements, taking no questions from reporters and offering no public protest when the White House proposed cutting the State Department budget by 37 percent without first consulting him. He suffered in silence, State Department officials said, when President Trump called, in a matter-of-fact way, to reject Mr. Tillerson’s choice for deputy secretary of state. He has been absent from the White House meetings with key world leaders, and when the State Department issued its annual report on human rights — usually a major moment for the United States to stand up against repression around the world — he skipped the announcement. Defenders say Mr. Tillerson has been accomplishing far more behind the scenes, including arranging for the first trip of a Saudi foreign minister to Iraq in more than a quarter-century — his first foray into the sinkhole of Middle East politics. “He’s already developing plans to begin ratcheting back Putin’s nefarious behavior,” Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview — steps that would represent the first known effort by the new administration to face off against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “He’s won status and respect of the president, of McMaster, and talks all the time to Jared,” the senator said, referring to the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who has emerged as a prominent voice on American foreign policy. “He doesn’t mind at all that these stories are being written about him being missing,” Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said about Mr. Tillerson. “When he’s ready to talk, you will be very highly impressed.” On Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson will leave for his first truly fraught diplomatic mission: a trip to Japan, South Korea and China, at a moment when open conflict with North Korea is a growing possibility, and when the administration is planning Mr. Trump’s first meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. The trip is so vital that the “principals” committee of the National Security Council is set to convene on Monday to discuss the North Korean threat and how to deal with China, so that Mr. Tillerson speaks from a consensus strategy. But do not expect to hear much about that strategy from the secretary before he arrives in Asia: The State Department has told reporters that they cannot ride on the plane. The decision appears to be unprecedented for a major diplomatic trip — even four decades ago, when Mr. Kissinger was conducting shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East and opening up China, he was delivering spin to reporters on the plane and offering up diplomatic tutorials. “All his predecessors have traveled with press,” said R. Nicholas Burns, who served as spokesman, ambassador and under secretary of state in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Failing to do so, he noted, creates the risk that the secretary of state will be defined by the country he is visiting — especially a place like China. Within the State Department, Mr. Tillerson, 64, got off to a promising start with a warm, humble greeting to staff members in the drab headquarters’ flag-draped foyer on his first day on the job. He talked about his upbringing and his wife’s belief that he had been preparing for this job his whole life, even if he had not known it. But few have heard from him since. Those who have say they regard him as an impressive manager who knows how to run a crisp meeting, take in a variety of views and give little away about his own. “He forces everyone to boil their memos down to a page or two, so they really have to think about what their message is,” said one official who has dealt with him frequently in recent weeks. “He’s already met with two of the most important Chinese officials. He knows a lot about some countries many secretaries don’t know about,” including Indonesia and others that have energy assets. He understands what embassies do, because Exxon Mobil often relied on them for help. But he is also introverted, a bit standoffish. He never met in person with John Kerry, his predecessor. “These guys came in to drain the swamp,” one career State Department official said, “and it’s clear that they are under orders not to cooperate or deal with swamp creatures.” So, for thousands in the State Department, Mr. Tillerson has come to be viewed as the phantom of Foggy Bottom, scarcely glimpsed and known mostly for his directives to wipe out some of the department’s top jobs. Longtime career officials who expected to stay in their jobs or remain long enough to show their successors the ropes were ousted in Mr. Tillerson’s first two weeks. He is talking to members of Congress about further cuts, and while there are plenty of opportunities in a department that has not exactly embraced technological change, the major reductions proposed by the administration are a nonstarter with many lawmakers. The biggest concern among diplomats and many in Congress is that when Mr. Trump talks about bolstering America’s commitment to its national security, he does not have diplomacy in mind. Longtime diplomats often cite — or email to reporters — a line uttered four years ago by the new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, when he was in charge of Central Command. “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition,” Mr. Mattis said at the time. As one diplomat who has met frequently with Mr. Tillerson since he took office noted recently, “Rex clearly agrees with that. He just won’t say it.” (A senior State Department official said Mr. Tillerson did say it, to Mr. Trump, over dinner a little more than a week ago.) On his first trip, to Europe, Mr. Tillerson went out of his way to reassure allies of the United States’ commitment to NATO, doing little to repeat the “America First” notion that Mr. Trump has promoted. In Asia, Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to visit the Demilitarized Zone on the border with North Korea, and it seems almost unimaginable that he would repeat Mr. Trump’s warning as a candidate that the United States may pull back from the region. So why is the man many in the State Department call T. Rex so quiet? Secretaries of state from both parties have relished their role as chief spokesman for American values. Madeleine K. Albright made her name describing the United States as the “indispensable nation” that needed to intervene in the Balkans. Colin L. Powell took the lead in making the case for invading Iraq (words he later regretted). Hillary Clinton, under President Barack Obama, highlighted human and women’s rights in particular. Mr. Kerry narrated his own role as relentless negotiator, sometimes using background briefings to read aloud from copious handwritten notes he had taken while haggling over the Iran nuclear deal and the removal of chemical weapons from Syria. In indiscreet moments, he talked about his differences of view, mostly on Syria, with Mr. Obama. There are several theories about Mr. Tillerson’s reticence. One is that his silence is highly strategic: He wants to cement key relationships in private, make sure he is aligned with a mercurial president and let the policy process at the National Security Council play out before making any grand pronouncements. The second is that he is waiting for the battles at the White House to burn out. In short, he wants to sidestep Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist, who believes that China’s rise can be halted and that Iran should be vigorously confronted, and work with Mr. Mattis, Mr. Kushner and Mr. McMaster. Mr. Corker said that “he’s already reached an agreement with Mattis to come to agreement and present ideas together,” something that Condoleezza Rice and Mrs. Clinton often did with their defense counterpart, Robert M. Gates. The third is that he sees the job as more akin to what he did at Exxon Mobil: Cut your deals, say as little as possible and take the heat. One of the first tests may come in the arena of human rights, where he caused alarm during his confirmation hearings in January by declining to criticize the killings ordered by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, in an antidrug campaign. Speaking out against repression has always been fraught; Mr. Kerry often danced around the topic when visiting Egypt. But Mr. Tillerson took up the issue on a recent call with Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, who was pressing him to link arms sales to Bahrain — home of the Fifth Fleet of the United States Navy — to measurable human rights improvements. “When we get the notifications of arms sales, it will be interesting to see if he has something to say on the issues we talked about,” Mr. Cardin said in an interview. He attributed some of Mr. Tillerson’s problems to the fact that “he doesn’t have his team in place.” “Having a subcabinet to back up your views,” Mr. Cardin added, “gives you the confidence to be more direct.” Clearly, Mr. Tillerson will not have much of a staff for a while; not a single under secretary or assistant secretary — the people who make the policy wheels turn — has been nominated, and only a couple of ambassadors have been named. Some say the problem is not with Mr. Tillerson, but those he works for. “Rex Tillerson is off to a slow start, but the White House is partly to blame,” said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, whom the administration briefly considered for a top post. “The president needs to give the secretary the staff he wants; protect, not decimate, his budget; and make clear to the world that it is the secretary and no one else who speaks for the administration when it comes to foreign policy.” Mr. Kissinger, at 93, is philosophical about most things, including Mr. Tillerson. “I would expect that as foreign policy evolves, Rex Tillerson will become an increasingly prominent exponent of it,” he said. “When I first came to Washington” as national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, “you would find me mentioned in The New York Times maybe 10 times.” A computer index suggests that the actual number in his first year was around 228, but who’s counting? Mr. Tillerson, in a sign of progress, has already exceeded that figure this year.","WASHINGTON — Henry A.

But they share an interest in international business and diplomacy. And they both know that their reputations will be closely scrutinized by President Trump’s critics. So it was no surprise when their meeting became public on Friday after the White House released photos from inside the department showing them together at a table in an otherwise empty room. It was also not surprising when the president later tweeted about the encounter: “Henry & I had a great discussion today. He knows more than anyone else alive on trade!” Mr. Tillerson’s meeting with Mr. Kissinger was part of what one senior administration official called an effort to show Mr. Tillerson in action. After spending much of last week holed up behind closed doors with aides, the new secretary began making appearances this week. On Monday, Mr. Tillerson held meetings with Secretary General Antonio Guterres of the United Nations; the foreign ministers of Japan, South Korea, India and Australia; the prime minister of New Zealand; and the president of Chad. On Tuesday, he traveled to Capitol Hill, where he spoke with senators of different parties and held private sessions with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, he was scheduled to meet with Secretary John F. Kerry, the departing Obama-era secretary of state. Mr. Tillerson also plans a trip next month to Mexico City, Washington, Brussels and London, according to people familiar with those discussions, and has been reaching out to other world leaders. In addition, he has begun reaching out to members of Congress to explain the rationale for some policy decisions the State Department made under Mrs. Clinton, including her decision in December to designate Iran a terrorist nation. He is expected to testify on Thursday before a Senate committee considering whether to confirm him, a hearing that could provide another opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to question Mr. Tillerson on issues ranging from human rights to climate change to Russia and China to North Korea. “The president wants to see him confirmed,” said Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of Mr. Trump’s harshest early detractors, who added, “I think there’s going to be a lot of questions asked, and we need answers.” “I want to make sure we get a full understanding of what happened at State and why,” said Representative Ed Royce of California, chairman of the foreign affairs panel. “We want to hear how he intends to fix the problems. We have a long way to go before we can say we have confidence in him.” But it will take time. In recent days, Mr. Tillerson’s advisers have sought to tamp down expectations that the former oil man would quickly turn around the troubled agency. They acknowledge the challenges facing him are immense. The State Department has lost thousands of employees since he left the company, many because of low morale. Many diplomats have grown frustrated with Mrs. Clinton, whose tenure ended amid controversy over how she handled classified information through a personal email account and server while serving at Foggy Bottom. Mr. Tillerson must rebuild relationships that were strained during Mrs. Clinton’s four years in charge. At the same time, he has promised Congress a major reorganization to streamline operations. Mr. Corker acknowledged that “there’s a learning curve” on the job and “it takes time to learn a bureaucracy like that.” But he warned against giving the secretary too much leeway: “If you don’t do your homework, you will fail. If he doesn’t do his homework, he’ll fail.” “There is no room for error,” he said, adding: “It is not a forgiving environment.” “This isn’t Exxon anymore. This isn’t business as usual,” Mr. Corker added, noting the secretary “has got to understand that, or we’re going to be disappointed.” In fact, it may be months before Mr. Tillerson begins to feel comfortable running the sprawling organization. “You don’t walk into an airplane cockpit and start flying right away,” Mr. Corker said, comparing it to a plane crash that killed three Americans. Mr. Corker has already suggested that Mr. Tillerson should begin to address his concerns over his qualifications for the post by hiring experienced career officials, rather than relying on political appointees, as the previous secretaries did. The senator also warned Mr. Tillerson that “he needs to learn quickly how to deal with this town.” “There is going to be a big difference between dealing with Congress on issues like sanctions on Iran and North Korea, which he dealt with all day every day for eight years,” he added. “And dealing with a congressman on an issue he disagrees with. That’s a whole other ball game.” Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said on Thursday that the Trump administration had not yet briefed him about its plans on Syria. He said Mr. Tillerson was scheduled to meet with senators next week but would have to answer questions first. “I think we need more information from them before they start briefing us,” he added. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has been critical of President Obama and Hillary Clinton over their handling of Libya, said the president should consider sending ground troops into the country if necessary. But Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of the most hawkish Republicans in Washington, was skeptical about military action, saying it could lead to another Iraq or Afghanistan, where American forces were bogged down with little progress. “We are talking about putting boots on the ground. We did that for decades,” Mr. McCain told reporters on Wednesday. “It didn’t work out very well.” The White House on Tuesday announced that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey agreed during talks last month in Ankara that Syrian rebels must withdraw their fighters to Idlib province by Feb. 11 or face being targeted. Mr. Erdogan and his Russian counterpart, Sergei L. Lavrov, met again this month in Sochi, Russia, to discuss implementation. On Thursday, Turkey said Mr. Assad must leave power as part of any solution to end Syria’s civil war. A spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, told CNN Turk television: “The only way forward in terms of a political transition in Syria is through negotiations that will bring the departure of Bashar al-Assad.” He added that Turkey’s priority was the protection of civilians, adding, “If there are no guarantees of the safety and security of people in these areas, then we cannot talk of anything else.” A senior State Department official on Friday declined to comment directly on whether the United States planned to arm anti-government groups inside Syria, saying that such decisions are made at higher levels. The official acknowledged that the administration’s policy toward Syria had changed since the election. The shift came after President Barack Obama made clear to President Trump that his predecessor had left office without having taken decisive steps against Syria for using chemical weapons and killing hundreds of Syrians. Mr. Obama ordered air strikes in April 2016 in response to what his aides described as his red line — use of banned chemicals by the government of the late dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Trump was reluctant to follow suit, according to former officials and others close to him. In early May 2017, the Pentagon presented to the new commander in chief options for punishing Syria. One proposal called for launching cruise missiles against three targets — including two research facilities — near Damascus and Homs, both strongholds of Syrian intelligence services. Another suggested bombing sites used to produce chlorine gas, sarin nerve agent and mustard gas. The third option involved striking chemical weapon storage depots. None of those proposals led to further discussion or planning for air attacks. Instead, in August, President Trump authorized air attacks on Shayrat Air Base, east of Latakia, where Syria stored some of its Scud missile launchers and aircraft. He followed up by ordering missiles fired into Deir el Zour Province, the center of Mr. Assad’s oil industry. A few days later, the United States launched Tomahawk land-based cruise missile strikes from ships off the coast of Yemen against Al Qaeda militants based in Sana. It is unclear whether any new decisions are under consideration. Aides say that the Syria debate continues within the West Wing and among outside advisers, but that Mr. Trump remains focused on domestic matters. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about intervening militarily in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.",Falcon,True,
36,"“We, the members of this grand jury, need you to hear this,” begins the nearly 900-page report released Tuesday by a grand jury that spent two years investigating reports of sexual abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church over a period of 70 years. The report, which says there were more than 1,000 identifiable victims and perhaps thousands more, is the broadest examination yet by a government agency in the United States of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Here are some excerpts.  The grand jury members documented a wide variety of abuses by priests and others within the church, as well as creative ways of covering up or denying accusations. “Even of those odious stories, some stood out,” the report reads.  Those cases include a priest who the grand jury says raped a 7-year-old girl while visiting her in the hospital after she got her tonsils out. Another priest made a 9-year-old boy give him oral sex, “then rinsed out the boy’s mouth with holy water to purify him.” [Read about the grand jury investigation and the church’s ‘playbook for concealing the truth.’] The grand jury used strong language to hold leaders of the church accountable for enabling and protecting the abusers.  Church leaders frequently protected and sympathized with the abusers, not their victims, the report states.  One of the cases that the grand jury reports on in great detail involves the Rev. Edward R. Graff, who served as a priest for 45 years, including 35 in the diocese of Allentown. During his years in ministry, Father Graff raped scores of children, the grand jury report says.  The church had documented numerous reports of Father Graff’s abuse over the years, the grand jury report says, and yet when they came to light publicly, the church downplayed and denied its knowledge. In 2002, Father Graff was arrested in Briscoe County, Tex., where he had continued his ministry, for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy, the grand jury report says. He died of injuries from an accident while in a Texas prison awaiting trial.  Another case documented by the grand jury involved a priest in the Harrisburg diocese who was accused of abusing many members of a large family in his parish during the 1980s.  The grand jury reported that it had uncovered a ring of predatory priests in the Pittsburgh diocese who “shared intelligence or information regarding victims,” created pornography using the victims, and exchanged victims among themselves. “This group of priests used whips, violence and sadism in raping their victims,” the report states. “George still has the cross and it was shown to the grand jury,” the report states.","“We, the members of this grand jury, need you to hear this,” begins the nearly 900-page report released Tuesday by a grand jury that spent two years investigating reports of sexual abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church over a period of 70 years.

The report, which says there were more than 1,000 identifiable victims and perhaps thousands more, is the broadest examination yet by a government agency in the United States of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.. It lays out an extraordinary catalogue of cover-ups, including at least one case where church officials paid off victims with settlements rather than reporting them to law enforcement officials. In addition to detailing decades of alleged crimes, it also describes how bishops, priests, nuns and other religious leaders conspired to keep their misdeeds secret. And, perhaps most strikingly, the grand jurors say they believe that Pope Francis knew about allegations against Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in New York but did not act on them until after he was forced to resign last year. The report is based on testimony from witnesses who have been interviewed under oath over a span of nearly a decade, as well as documents obtained through subpoenas, civil lawsuits and court records. The report’s release comes amid growing calls for accountability within the American hierarchy of Roman Catholics following revelations in recent months of widespread clergy sex abuse of children in several countries. But its findings are especially damning because it details not only what happened to hundreds of people, many of whom remain unidentified, but also what appears to be a deliberate effort to conceal those abuses and protect abusers from prosecution. The report was issued on behalf of the Altoona–Johnstown Diocese of Bishop Mark Bartchak by a jury drawn from Blair County. In his introduction to the document, the grand juror, John J. Vican Jr., writes: “The purpose of our investigation was not to assign blame or apportion guilt.” Instead, he said, the goal was to determine whether any laws had been broken and “to identify and address the root causes that allowed these terrible acts to occur.” He added, “Our investigation has shown us that those causes were systemic throughout our diocese, our nation and beyond.” Mr. Vican also wrote that he believed Pope Benedict XVI had known about accusations that Father Lawrence Cionni abused boys while serving as pastor at St. Joseph Parish in Hollidaysburg, Pa., beginning in the late 1970s. The pope resigned from public life in February 2013, citing health concerns. A spokesman for the Vatican declined to comment on Tuesday. Bishop Bartchak told reporters he would read through the report before making further comments about how his diocese will respond to it. A spokeswoman for Bishop David Zubik, head of the Pittsburgh diocese, told reporters on Tuesday that she had just received the document, so it was too soon to know how it might affect her diocese, which includes 10 counties in western and central Pennsylvania. She said, however, that her office was already working on a plan for dealing with past cases and future ones. “I can tell you we take very seriously all matters related to protecting minors and vulnerable adults,” Ms. Dinniman said. “We want to do everything possible to prevent such behavior in our parishes and schools and ensure anyone harmed receives help and healing.” Bishop Bartchak has previously acknowledged that he failed in some instances to follow proper procedures when handling complaints of priest misconduct. “It’s very clear from what I see here that I didn’t handle things correctly,” he told CNN affiliate WTAE. “And I apologize for that and ask forgiveness of anybody I may have hurt or disappointed.” Bishop Bartchak is now retired and living in Florida. His predecessor in the Altoona diocese, Archbishop Anthony Mankelka, died in 2007, according to diocese records, though Bishop Bartchak said that he did not learn that fact until recently. Mr. Vican and two fellow grand juror, James E. O’Hara and Thomas P. Quigley, both lawyers who live in Pennsylvania, spoke to reporters outside a courthouse here. They described the process they went through and explained why the grand jury decided not to indict Cardinal Donald T.Wuerl, then bishop of Washington. He became archbishop of Philadelphia and cardinal emeritus of Washington last month, the first time a U.S. prelate held those titles simultaneously. Mr. Vican, 58, was born and raised in Altoona and attended high school there before going on to earn degrees at Penn State University and Duquesne University School of Law. A former prosecutor, he worked in private practice for many years before becoming an assistant district attorney in Cambria County in southwestern Pennsylvania. He later served in various roles for the state Department of Corrections, the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, the Blair County District Attorney’s Office, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and as chief counsel to Governor Tom Corbett. In his role as chief legal officer, Mr. Vican oversaw a team that investigated allegations against clergy members who sexually assaulted and molested more than 100 young victims. That work led him and the grand jury to conclude that the Altoona Diocese was rife with problems for many years. The grand jurors found evidence, among other things, that Cardinal Bernard F alsely claimed he had no knowledge of sexual abuse in the diocese and that Bishop Joseph Adamec, then bishop of Johnstown, had failed to protect children from known abusers. Mr. Vican said the investigation was not limited to the Diocese of Harrisburg, but also included other Catholic organizations and institutions in the state. He said that the grand jury’s findings were based on interviews and documents obtained through subpoenas, including “thousands of pages” from a confidential list that was given to the grand jury by victims, which contained names of priests accused of abusing minors. Mr. Vican, a graduate of Penn State University’s Dickinson School of Law, is married with three grown sons. and has lived in State College for more than 30 years. He said the grand jury’s report would be made public at some point after it is reviewed by prosecutors for any potential legal action against those named. The grand jury, formed by Judge William Eshbach in June 2016, issued its final findings after reviewing evidence gathered over the course of several months. It concluded that there was sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to indict two men who worked as teachers or counselors in schools run by the Roman Catholic Church. One man is charged with sexually assaulting one boy, while another faces charges related to “sexual contact” with a second victim. Both are former employees of St. Pius X High School in Altoona. A third person charged is the Rev. James J. Brennan, pastor of Our Lady Help of Christians Parish, an Erie church where Mr. Vican once served on its parish council. A fourth individual, identified only as an employee of a school run by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, was indicted for allegedly possessing child pornography. All four have pleaded innocent. A fifth defendant is awaiting trial in Blair County Court after being charged with indecent exposure in connection with allegations that he exposed himself to students in 2012 and 2013. The report says that the abuse occurred between 1960 and 2009, when Bishop Anthony Gualtieri led the Harrisburg diocese. It does not name specific parishes or dioceses that may have been involved. But the grand jury found that there had been an effort to conceal information about abuse within the church in order to avoid scandal. In addition, it said that some bishops and others knew about allegations of abuse and did nothing about them. The report makes clear the scope of the problem and how widespread sexual abuse was. It states that 37 people abused children in Pennsylvania alone between 1947 and 1991. Of that number, 26 cases of clergy abuse occurred between 1960 and 1988. It says there are at least 26 victims. In his statement on Tuesday, the bishop apologized again for what happened to the boys. He added, however, that he could offer little else beyond those words, because of confidentiality laws that prevent him from discussing details of specific victims or their families. Mr. Vican said the report did not include all the facts and figures he wanted to see included in a full accounting. But he added, “I think we can say, without equivocation, that this report shows a systemic cover-up of abuse in our churches.” He said that the diocese had already taken steps to address the issue, including the creation of new policies to ensure that employees undergo background checks before they work in the parish system, as well as mandatory training in recognizing signs of child sexual abuse and reporting such incidents to law enforcement officials. He added, “We will continue to take every possible step to make sure the safety of all parishioners, especially children and youth, is paramount in everything we do as an institution of faith.” In response to questions, the Rev. Edward Maleski, vicar general for Bishop Lawrence Persico of Altoona, issued a brief written statement saying, “The report has no bearing on our current practices.” The Rev. James Cawley, spokesman for the Pittsburgh archdiocese, declined comment. The dioceses in Scranton, Greensburg and Lancaster said they could provide only statements similar to the ones released on behalf of Bishop Adamec, whose resignation was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. Mr. Vican said the grand jury had found a pattern in diocesan behavior. “They found that this is systemic,” he said. “It wasn’t just one bad apple; there are many.” Mr. Vican said the diocese would now face scrutiny as part of civil lawsuits filed by alleged victims against the Catholic Church. “This isn’t going away,” he said.",Falcon,True,
37,"INDIANAPOLIS — Twenty-five years ago, when Connecticut began its ascent to the summit of women’s college basketball, the program resembled the current Oregon State team, which unexpectedly captured the Dallas Region this season to reach its first Final Four. If the Beavers can replicate UConn’s success, solace can be found after the Huskies dominated them, 80-51, on Sunday in the N.C.A.A. tournament semifinals at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. UConn’s Morgan Tuck scored a game-high 21 points. Breanna Stewart, who won her third straight national player of the year award on Saturday, finished with 16 points and 8 rebounds. “It’s hard to not be impressed by the things that Morgan Tuck did in that first-half run that we had,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. In 1991, UConn reached its first Final Four, losing to Virginia in the semifinals. Since that defeat, the Huskies have reached 16 additional Final Fours, including the last nine. A victory in Tuesday’s championship game would result in UConn’s fourth straight national title and 11th over all. Before Auriemma arrived in Storrs, UConn was an anonymous program. Postseason tournaments were foreign territory.  When Beavers Coach Scott Rueck took over at Oregon State, his alma mater, in 2010, the team occupied a space almost beyond obscurity. The previous coach, LaVonda Wagner, was fired amid allegations by players that she had verbally abused them, among other problems, and most of the team fled Corvallis. Rueck held open tryouts to fill a roster that came to include soccer and volleyball players. “It’s really exciting, the future,” Beavers center Ruth Hamblin said after the game. “I think we just set the bar high.” Rueck had come from Division III George Fox University in Newberg, Ore., where he constructed his program in the Connecticut mold. He said last week that he would pore over team stats, comparing George Fox’s rankings in Division III categories with where UConn stood in Division I. In 2009, Rueck led George Fox to a 32-0 record and the national title.  With Sunday’s victory, Connecticut moved to 37-0. It was the Huskies’ 74th consecutive victory over all, and it extended their streak of N.C.A.A. tournament wins to a record 23. The Beavers did not enter the game overwhelmed by the task before them. At one point during warm-ups, the team paused and coolly tried to stack eight basketballs at once in the hoop.  But when the game tipped off, the ball went through the net less frequently, and the Huskies quickly demonstrated the chasm that separated the programs. Tuck scored 10 of Connecticut’s first 15 points as the Huskies built a 9-point lead. Despite Tuck’s hot start, UConn faced a potentially perilous situation early when Stewart picked up her second foul just 2 minutes 5 seconds into the game. But Oregon State did not regularly challenge her on defense to draw a third foul, and UConn made nine of its first 12 shots to lead after the first quarter, 26-17. Stewart was held scoreless over the first 17 minutes and had 2 points on two field-goal attempts as UConn led at the half, 47-26.  “Yeah, I wanted to take her out,” Auriemma said, referring to Stewart and her early foul trouble. “And she looked at me and she said: ‘I got it. I’m all right.’ ” Despite Stewart’s unusually spotty contributions in the first half, compensation came by way of the reserves Napheesa Collier and Gabby Williams. The pair combined for 10 points, 4 steals and a stream of blocks, offensive rebounds and charges taken that propelled the Huskies to close the second quarter on a 15-2 run. When Oregon State guard Jamie Weisner missed a layup at the buzzer, she tossed the ball in the air in frustration. “I think what most impressed me was how destructive they were on defense and even offense,” Stewart said of Collier and Williams. Sydney Wiese led Oregon State with 13 points, but the Beavers could never put together strong runs — only once did they make three baskets in a row. Eighteen turnovers further sabotaged their cause, and UConn never trailed. “They can hit from everywhere,” Weisner said. “People come off the bench, and there’s no lag. They expose every weakness and make you pay for it, force you to do things you don’t want to do.” Despite a crisp first half, UConn received troubling news when it was determined that the freshman starter Katie Lou Samuelson had broken a bone in her left foot. She returned to the bench area early in the third quarter wearing a walking boot.  After the game, Auriemma guessed that the injury had happened on one of UConn’s first possessions, when Samuelson drove to the basket, but she continued to play on. “It wasn’t until late in the first half that we found out that there was something wrong,” Auriemma said. “Then, by halftime, when we were in the locker room, we knew that when she wasn’t back in the locker room right away, it had to be something.” Without Samuelson at forward, Stewart took over on offense, going 6 for 8 from the field in the second half, during which UConn led by as many as 34 points. When Stewart exited the game with 2:48 remaining, having helped her team claw within a victory of her fourth national championship, she walked over to Samuelson on the bench and rubbed her head, which elicited a smile. “I think my thoughts coming off the bench was just being there to kind of comfort her,” Stewart said. “I don’t know how much it’s going to help, but kind of giving her the idea that we got this.”","INDIANAPOLIS — Twenty-five years ago, when Connecticut began its ascent to the summit of women’s college basketball, the program resembled the current Oregon State team, which unexpectedly captured the Dallas Region this season to reach its first Final Four.

Okafor picked up his fourth foul, casting him to the bench, and the Blue Devils turned to Jones and Grayson Allen, an oft-overlooked reserve guard, to stir up the offense.

38,"WASHINGTON — After decades of maintaining a minimal nuclear force, China has re-engineered many of its long-range ballistic missiles to carry multiple warheads, a step that federal officials and policy analysts say appears designed to give pause to the United States as it prepares to deploy more robust missile defenses in the Pacific. What makes China’s decision particularly notable is that the technology of miniaturizing warheads and putting three or more atop a single missile has been in Chinese hands for decades. But a succession of Chinese leaders deliberately let it sit unused; they were not interested in getting into the kind of arms race that characterized the Cold War nuclear competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, however, President Xi Jinping appears to have altered course, at the same moment that he is building military airfields on disputed islands in the South China Sea, declaring exclusive Chinese “air defense identification zones,” sending Chinese submarines through the Persian Gulf for the first time and creating a powerful new arsenal of cyberweapons. Many of those steps have taken American officials by surprise and have become evidence of the challenge the Obama administration faces in dealing with China, in particular after American intelligence agencies had predicted that Mr. Xi would focus on economic development and follow the path of his predecessor, who advocated the country’s “peaceful rise.” Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Beijing on Saturday to discuss a variety of security and economic issues of concern to the United States, although it remained unclear whether this development with the missiles, which officials describe as recent, was on his agenda. American officials say that, so far, China has declined to engage in talks on the decision to begin deploying multiple nuclear warheads atop its ballistic missiles. “The United States would like to have a discussion of the broader issues of nuclear modernization and ballistic missile defense with China,” said Phillip C. Saunders, director of the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at National Defense University, a Pentagon-funded academic institution attended by many of the military’s next cadre of senior commanders. “The Chinese have been reluctant to have that discussion in official channels,” Mr. Saunders said, although he and other experts have engaged in unofficial conversations with their Chinese counterparts on the warhead issue. Beijing’s new nuclear program was reported deep inside the annual Pentagon report to Congress about Chinese military capabilities, disclosing a development that poses a dilemma for the Obama administration, which has never talked publicly about these Chinese nuclear advances. President Obama is under more pressure than ever to deploy missile defense systems in the Pacific, although American policy officially states that those interceptors are to counter North Korea, not China. At the same time, the president is trying to find a way to signal that he will resist Chinese efforts to intimidate its neighbors, including some of Washington’s closest allies, and to keep the United States out of the Western Pacific. Already, there is talk in the Pentagon of speeding up the missile defense effort and of sending military ships into international waters near the disputed islands, to make it clear that the United States will insist on free navigation even in areas that China is claiming as its exclusive zone. Hans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, a policy research group in Washington, called the new deployments of Chinese warheads “a bad day for nuclear constraint.” “China’s little force is slowly getting a little bigger,” he said, “and its limited capabilities are slowly getting a little better.” To American officials, the Chinese move fits into a rapid transformation of their strategy under Mr. Xi, now considered one of the most powerful leaders since Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping. Vivid photographs, which were released recently, of Chinese efforts to reclaim land on disputed islands in the South China Sea and immediately build airfields on them, underscored for White House policy makers and military planners the speed and intensity of Mr. Xi’s determination to push potential competitors out into the mid-Pacific. That has involved building aircraft carriers and submarines to create an overall force that could pose a credible challenge to the United States in the event of a regional crisis. Some of China’s military modernization program has been aimed directly at America’s technological advantage. China has sought technologies to block American surveillance and communications satellites, and its major investments in cybertechnology — and probes and attacks on American computer networks — are viewed by American officials as a way to both steal intellectual property and prepare for future conflict. The upgrade to the nuclear forces fits into that strategy. “This is obviously part of an effort to prepare for long-term competition with the United States,” said Ashley J. Tellis, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who was a senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration. “The Chinese are always fearful of American nuclear advantage.” American nuclear forces today outnumber China’s by eight to one. The choice of which nuclear missiles to upgrade was notable, Mr. Tellis said, because China chose “one of few that can unambiguously reach the United States.” The United States pioneered multiple warheads early in the Cold War. The move was more threatening than simply adding arms. In theory, one missile could release warheads that adjusted their flight paths so each zoomed toward a different target. The term for the technical advance — multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle, or MIRV — became one of the Cold War’s most dreaded fixtures. It embodied the horrors of overkill and unthinkable slaughter. Each re-entry vehicle was a miniaturized hydrogen bomb. Each, by definition, was many times more destructive than the crude atomic weapon that leveled Hiroshima. China watched all this from the sidelines. Gingerly, it improved its warheads and missile forces in what amounted to baby steps, but chose to field a force that the leadership in Beijing believed could deter aggression with the smallest number of deployed warheads. In 1999, during the Clinton administration, Republicans in Congress charged that Chinese spies had stolen the secrets of H-bomb miniaturization. But intelligence agencies noted Beijing’s restraint. “For 20 years,” the C.I.A. reported, “China has had the technical capability to develop” missiles with multiple warheads and could, if so desired, upgrade its missile forces with MIRVs “in a few years.” The calculus shifted in 2004, when the Bush administration began deploying a ground-based antimissile system in Alaska and California. Early in 2013, the Obama administration, worrying about North Korean nuclear advances, ordered an upgrade. It called for the interceptors to increase in number to 44 from 30. While administration officials emphasized that Chinese missiles were not in the system’s cross hairs, they acknowledged that the growing number of interceptors might shatter at least some of Beijing’s warheads. Today, analysts see China’s addition of multiple warheads as at least partly a response to Washington’s antimissile strides. “They’re doing it,” Mr. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists said, “to make sure they could get through the ballistic missile defenses.” The Pentagon report, released on May 8, said that Beijing’s most powerful weapon now bore MIRV warheads. The intercontinental ballistic missile is known as the DF-5 (for Dong Feng, or East Wind). The Pentagon has said that China has about 20 in underground silos. Private analysts said each upgraded DF-5 had probably received three warheads and that the advances might span half the missile force. If so, the number of warheads China can fire from that weapon at the United States has increased to about 40 from 20. “It’s been a long time coming,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on Chinese nuclear forces at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In an interview, he emphasized that even fewer of the DF-5s might have received the upgrade. Early last week, Mr. Kristensen posted a public report on the missile intelligence. Beijing’s new membership in “the MIRV club,” he said, “strains the credibility of China’s official assurance that it only wants a minimum nuclear deterrent and is not part of a nuclear arms race.”","WASHINGTON — After decades of maintaining a minimal nuclear force, China has re-engineered many of its long-range ballistic missiles to carry multiple warheads, a step that federal officials and policy analysts say appears designed to give pause to the United States as it prepares to deploy more robust missile defenses in the Pacific.

In addition to the new capability, China also announced this month that it had successfully test-fired a hypersonic glide vehicle capable of striking targets anywhere in the world. “China is clearly signaling they are willing to use their nuclear forces against U.S. second strike capabilities,” said Frank A. Gaffney Jr., president of the Center for Security Policy who advised Mr. Trump during the campaign about defense issues. “They have made clear they want us to think twice when we contemplate trying to defend ourselves from them.” While China has always maintained a significant arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate-range land-based missiles, those weapons were never intended to target the continental United States because American anti-missile systems could intercept them well above Earth’s atmosphere. But over time, China began developing longer-ranged missiles that can fly farther than 3,400 miles, deep into the Western Hemisphere. Those include the Dong Feng 26 (DF-26), known by NATO code name YJ-18, which is believed to have a range of up to 950 miles; the DF-31A, which carries three MIRVed warheads and has a range exceeding 700 miles; and the submarine-launched JL-2, which is estimated to have a range between 2,000 and 2,500 nautical miles. With each launch, Beijing has added another layer of complexity to any potential conflict involving the two countries. Now, if the Pentagon deploys additional missile defenses in Guam, Hawaii and Alaska, China might decide to respond by using one of these newer, multiwarhead missiles rather than the older ones that would likely be destroyed by the American system. It remains unclear whether the deployment of such weaponry would lead to an escalation toward full-scale nuclear exchange. But the development underscores how much uncertainty there still is regarding the intentions behind China’s military modernization efforts. Many experts believe that while China may be seeking regional hegemony in East Asia, it does not seek global dominance like Russia under Vladimir V. Putin. Still, some scholars argue that China’s behavior suggests otherwise: Its military buildup includes stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and other sophisticated equipment that indicate an intention to challenge the United States across all domains of power. And although China has signed treaties banning biological and chemical weapons, it continues to develop offensive cyberweapons and space-related technologies, including satellites used for intelligence gathering. Last year, China conducted five times as many tests of ground-to-ground rockets compared with the previous decade, according to data compiled by the Missile Defense Project, part of the Union of Concerned Scientists. This year alone, the country launched eight different types of missiles, ranging from conventional cruise and surface-to-air models to the newest generation of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Some of the tests appeared aimed directly at the United States, raising concerns among lawmakers and former senior government officials. For example, on July 27, China fired a DF-26 missile from Xichang Air Force Base near Chengdu City in Sichuan Province. According to the Missile Defense Agency, the rocket flew approximately 1,500 kilometers, passing within 250 kilometers of Taiwan and landing inside Japanese territorial waters. That same day, the State Department issued a statement condemning the test, saying that “the flight path of this missile demonstrated once again the threat posed by China’s destabilizing, militarily significant activities around and beyond its territory.” On Aug. 3, China carried out four separate tests of the DF-26, firing it from multiple locations throughout western China. Two days later, it launched six more DF-26s — a record number for a single test — from the eastern coastal city of Qingdao, where the Chinese navy maintains a base. All seven rockets traveled thousands of miles through airspace controlled by Japan or South Korea before crashing harmlessly into the sea. Although China did not announce the purpose of the tests, analysts speculated that they were designed to demonstrate the missile’s range and accuracy as well as its ability to penetrate American defenses in Asia. The United States has deployed advanced antimissiles around Seoul and Tokyo but is still developing an effective system capable of shooting down incoming ballistic missiles over long distances at high altitudes. In addition, the Pentagon has been trying since 2013 to develop a new generation of interceptor missiles with greater speed and maneuverability than current models. A successful demonstration would have given Beijing confidence that it could overcome any such defense. “The message was clear: We can reach you anywhere,” said Zhou Chenming, a retired colonel who commanded a regiment equipped with medium-range missiles during his service in the People’s Liberation Army. He said he believed that the launches had demonstrated both the weapon’s potential and its limitations. “It’s very difficult to destroy these types of missiles once they are inside your territory.” But the tests also raised questions about how far away from their intended targets the weapons might be able to travel without being detected until too late. One of the two Japanese officials familiar with the details of last month’s drill said the missiles flew farther than expected because of unforeseen wind patterns. That official added that the trajectory of one rocket appeared to suggest that it had flown even deeper into the Pacific Ocean than planned. While the flight paths remained classified, the Japanese government estimated that each missile traveled between 450 kilometers (about 280 miles) and 700 kilometers (more than 435 miles). If true, those ranges would exceed what experts say is necessary to hit major cities like Osaka or Nagoya on Honshu Island, which lie closer to North Korean artillery positions near the Sea of Japan. It remains unclear whether the missiles could strike targets further west along the island chain, including Okinawa Prefecture, home to several important military bases. Still, the fact that the Chinese tested so many missiles within just three weeks suggested that they may now possess enough capability to threaten every part of Japan except the northernmost islands off Hokkaido. “This is really something we need to take seriously if this becomes routine practice,” said Toshi Yoshihara, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Mr. Yoshihara noted that the tests coincided with preparations for President Trump’s visit to Japan next weekend for talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “There will certainly be discussions about deterring threats posed by North Korea and China, especially after Pyongyang conducted another nuclear test earlier today,” he wrote in an email. The latest round of testing came less than four months after North Korea claimed to have successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb aboard an intercontinental ballistic missile. At least five other countries besides China — Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel and France — already operate similar weapons systems. And while the United States has yet to deploy them domestically, some believe that a version called Ground Based Interceptors, or GBI, could become operational soon. Last year, the Pentagon began work on a program known as Redesigned Kill Vehicle, or RKV, aimed at improving the performance of existing interceptors. But despite years of development costs, the program has suffered repeated setbacks and delays. The Pentagon plans to conduct additional tests of the GBI early next year, according to a spokesman, Lt. Col. Christopher Sherwood. “We remain confident that our homeland defense capabilities are strong against all currently fielded ICBMs,” Colonel Sherwood said. “Our goal continues to be to improve upon the effectiveness of our homeland defense posture across all domains.” Some experts question why China needs to keep testing its own arsenals when it appears to rely heavily on Russian technology. They note that the country does not appear to have developed the sophisticated guidance systems needed to ensure that warheads actually hit their intended targets.",LLaMa2,True,
39,"Without a trace of bitterness, the billionaire Stephen A. Wynn once described his divorce from Elaine P. Wynn as the most expensive in American history. They evenly split his stake in the casino-resort company they co-founded and seemed to remain compatible leaders of some of the most profitable hotel-casinos in the world. Now that amicability itself may be history — and the fate of the $13 billion enterprise they built together could hang in the balance. After Ms. Wynn filed suit to lift divorce-related restrictions on the sale of her stock, fellow board members voted this month against nominating her for another term — despite her status as a co-founder, the third-largest shareholder and the only director who is not a white man. The board said it was eliminating her seat and is recommending retention of two other directors to the seats they now hold. Ms. Wynn, 72, has countered with a direct appeal to shareholders, urging them to choose her, instead, for one of the two remaining seats. The results of the vote will be announced at an April 24 shareholder meeting in Las Vegas, four days before the 10th anniversary of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, which is also her birthday. On Monday in New York she accelerated an already extraordinary public relations campaign, outlining a schedule of meetings with institutional investors on Wall Street who will vote in the proxy battle. She is challenging claims by the company’s governance committee that she has conflicts of interest and lacks the independence necessary to work in the best interest of shareholders. “I am the DNA of Wynn Resorts,” said Ms. Wynn, who has retained the proxy specialist firm Abernathy MacGregor and a Democratic political consultant, Mark D. Fabiani. On Friday she opened a website, elaineforwynn.com, which urges her re-election as a “co-founder, industry veteran and independent voice.” “Anybody that has a scintilla of knowledge about my history and my working relationship” with Mr. Wynn, she said in her first interview about the dispute, “knows the vital role that I play.”  “If you take me out of the mix, there’s no one at the company who has any kind of operational history in depth that I do,” she said. The fight is in sharp contrast to the immediate aftermath of her January 2010 divorce from Mr. Wynn, 73, the chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts Ltd., after 46 years of marriage. At that time, the two made much of how amicable their dissolution had been by pointing out he had agreed without a fight to give her half of his stake in the company, as well as various real estate holdings and her pick of their celebrated art collection. The move turned her into a billionaire in her own right. She was no mere corporate wife, Mr. Wynn said then, but a critical part of the company’s success. “We’re still partners in the business; I respect and value and really covet her opinion on issues,” he said in March 2010. “She has a real feel for the business that’s terrific.” Yet that agreement also restricted both Wynns from selling any shares of the company without the other’s consent and requires them to vote in concert, although Ms. Wynn received a waiver to sell $10 million worth of stock per year. Each owned about $1.3 billion in stock as of the market’s close on Monday. The stock has nearly doubled since their divorce, with the company’s market capitalization estimated at $13.2 billion.  In 2012 Ms. Wynn sued her ex-husband in federal court to alter their arrangement and give her the power to sell her shares at will. The two own a combined 19.3 percent of the company, with the investment firm T. Rowe Price holding the next largest share at about 16.8 percent. The fear is that should Ms. Wynn be allowed to sell as much of her stock as she wishes, the couple could lose their controlling interest and Mr. Wynn’s authority over the company could be jeopardized. Ms. Wynn’s continuing lawsuit and apparent desire to sell make her unsuitable for board service because they show her to be acting out of self-interest and not the company’s interest, said Robert J. Miller, chairman of the board’s governance committee. He noted that Ms. Wynn had sold the $10 million in stock she has been permitted to sell every year. “In meetings with Ms. Wynn, she was consistently unable to indicate how her lawsuit benefited any other shareholder, while putting the company and other shareholders’ interests at risk,” Mr. Miller, a Democratic former governor of Nevada and longtime friend of both Wynns, said in an interview. “From an independent director’s vantage point,” he said, “our obligation is to review any candidacy based on the best interests of the overall shareholders themselves.” Ms. Wynn has said that she has no intention of setting off a power shift but that she wishes to gain control over her assets and may wish to sell some piece of her holdings to fund her philanthropic efforts. Mr. Wynn declined to comment. Because the shareholder agreement remains in effect, Mr. Wynn is contractually obligated to support her candidacy to remain on the board regardless of his personal wishes. She begins her proxy battle, then, with about 19.3 percent of the vote in a three-way race for two seats, so her fate largely depends on investors like Price and seven other firms that combined hold 37.7 percent of the company. Aside from Ms. Wynn, the company’s board is entirely composed of white men, a peculiarity in this age of diversity on corporate boards and an angle Ms. Wynn is aggressively pursuing in her campaign. By contrast, MGM Resorts International, a gambling company of similar market capitalization, has three women on its board, including one who is African-American, as well as Roland Hernandez, a Latino, who is the former chief executive of Telemundo. The issue of diversity could be potent, some experts said, considering that the company is part of the hospitality industry and studies have shown women are the primary decision makers when it comes to travel plans. “It may resonate as an important issue because there are so few women on boards and the standard reason is that there aren’t women who have been in executive positions in whatever industry for 30 years or so, but in this case you have a woman with such exceptional experience,” said Erik Gordon, a corporate governance expert at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. A Wynn spokesman, Michael Weaver, said that Wynn Resorts “is engaged in a search for women and other diverse candidates and will expand the board with at least one qualified candidate by the end of the year.” While Ms. Wynn points to her renomination in 2012, after she filed her lawsuit against Mr. Wynn, as evidence that concerns about her independence and board performance are new, personal and unfounded, the corporate governance firm Glass, Lewis & Company recommended against her reappointment then. Given her legal dispute with Mr. Wynn, “we believe her continued presence on the board may prove to distract the other directors from carrying out their duties to shareholders,” the firm said in part. Ms. Wynn had not been aware of that report until Monday. A different assessment, from Institutional Shareholder Services in 2012, recommended that she be reappointed. Since her divorce, Ms. Wynn has been almost entirely focused on philanthropic work. She is the chairwoman of Communities in Schools, a nationwide high school dropout prevention program. In 2013 she was appointed to the Nevada Board of Education by Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican; she is now its president. She also drew attention by purchasing a Francis Bacon triptych for $142.4 million last November, then having it shipped not to her Las Vegas home but to Oregon, a move that allowed her to potentially avoid a $11 million state tax bill for the purchase. Last year, after a review of executive compensation requested by Institutional Shareholder Services, the company changed its pay packages to lower Mr. Wynn’s base salary, limit his use of the corporate jet and issue half of his bonus in stock. Mr. Wynn asked Ms. Wynn to grant him a waiver to sell the stock he received in that package, but she refused. He claimed that she told him she wanted to use the stock as leverage over him, according to sources close to Mr. Wynn. In an interview, she declined to say whether the anecdote was true, but said that her current relationship with Mr. Wynn was far from hostile. She said he still called her to discuss business, family and politics, and recently he left her a voice mail message complimenting her on her oversight of the design of staff uniforms for the new casino property in Macau. “The conflict that may be created in the boardroom is not coming from Elaine Wynn,” she said. “Elaine Wynn is the no-drama queen.” The company has indicated it will fight Ms. Wynn’s campaign in big and small ways that include prohibiting her from using the corporate logo on her website. When the site opened on Friday, the logo was used in place of her last name; over the weekend, after a stern letter from the company’s lawyers, her name was fully written in her own hand. “The company reminded Ms. Wynn that company trademarks are reserved for company business,” Mr. Weaver, the Wynn Resorts spokesman, said. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the opening date of the Encore hotel. It opened in 2008; it is not opening next week.","Without a trace of bitterness, the billionaire Stephen A. Wynn once described his divorce from Elaine P.

Wynn once described his divorce from Elaine P. Wynn as the most expensive in American history. They evenly split his stake in the casino-resort company they co-founded and seemed to remain compatible leaders of some of the most profitable hotel-casinos in the world.. But Ms. Wynn’s relationship with Mr. Wynn was rocky for years, and he eventually left her for another woman — one who would soon be known as “Mrs. Steve.” She filed for divorce last year after months of allegations that she had been unfaithful to him by sleeping with other men, including two bodyguards hired by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. The couple married on Sept. 19, 2000, at St. John’s Roman Catholic Church in Las Vegas, where Mr. Wynn is buried. Their marriage has never been legally recognized, but it remains an enduring symbol of their union, which lasted more than seven decades. It also became a subject of intense speculation about what might have happened if Mrs. Wynn had not wed Mr. Wynn. In recent weeks, there were reports that Mr. Wynn was considering taking steps against her. He was quoted as saying: “I am not going to stand here and defend my wife when I know that this has been going on for so long.” For many people, it is difficult to imagine how such a marriage could ever have worked out, given the personalities involved. Yet it did. Mr. Wynn and Ms. Wynn met at age 19 and began dating in 1990, according to court records. After several years together, they decided to marry in 1999. They married for 50 days before divorcing in 2001. The marriage ended in divorce in 2012. “It was a very happy marriage,” said David Tisch, the chief executive of the Wynn Resorts family, referring to Mr. Wynn’s first marriage. “We were both very much into our careers. We had good jobs. There was no bad blood between us.” “They loved each other dearly,” added Paul Ruddy, who served as chairman of the board of Wynn Resorts and its predecessor companies until 2013. “They were friends, and we’d see them every weekend.” Mr. Wynn died in May 2014, just hours after being released from prison following a plea deal. Ms. Wynn remained in touch with Mr. Trump throughout her life, even as he pursued other women. In 2008, she told People magazine that she had been sleeping with Mr. Trump since 1998. When asked in November 2015 whether she still had any contact with Mr. Trump, she replied, “No.” She also denied having slept with him again in 2016, shortly after Mr. Trump won the presidency. His lawyers have said that he had nothing to do with the accusations of infidelity. “The fact that he has made statements like that is unfortunate,” said William S. Zartman, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. “But I think it speaks volumes to the state of affairs he has in his life.” Mr. Wynn’s business empire included casinos, hotels and resorts, real estate development and golf courses, along with numerous television stations, newspapers and magazines. He built up the Trump Organization over nearly three decades, building it to become one of the largest privately held companies in America. In 1987, he sold off all his holdings in the company and went public, becoming a major player in the financial markets. Since then, he has accumulated $2 billion worth of assets, according to Forbes magazine. His wealth grew steadily through the early 2000s, and by 2007, he was worth roughly $1.5 billion. By 2011, he was worth $3.4 billion. But by 2014, he was worth close to $6 billion. At the height of the dot-com boom, he was worth close to $10 billion. He earned billions in income from those investments, as well as millions from his resort holdings. As the value of his stakes soared, so too did the value of his homes. He owned vast tracts of land in Florida, California, Nevada and Arizona, among others. And he had a private jet, a helicopter and a yacht that he used regularly. He had a reputation as a philanthropist, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to charity. His fortune was estimated to be around $1.8 billion by Bloomberg News. Ms. Wynn, a former Playboy Playmate, has been married twice, first to Michael B. Jordan, and later to Jeff Bridges, a musician. She was divorced from Mr. Jordan in 2006. Her second husband, Robert Linder, was killed in a car accident in 2009. She and Mr. Wynn are survived by four children. Mr. Trump himself has said that he does not believe Ms. Wynn cheated on him, although he has repeatedly called her “the most beautiful woman in the world.” During the campaign, he has repeatedly suggested that she was a con artist who took advantage of his generosity to make millions for herself. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said: “I don’t think it would be fair to say I don’t know if there is any truth to what she says about me. But I do know that she is a very dishonest person, and she is trying to take advantage of people. And I have been very generous to her.” He added: “She is doing this because she knows it will work, and she knows it will be good for business.” On Thursday evening, Mrs. Wynn released a statement saying that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer after undergoing chemotherapy. Her family said they were grateful that someone else could step forward to help them through their difficult time. In a series of tweets late Friday night, Mr. Trump wrote: “I am so happy that my friend @HillaryClinton has finally decided to run again! It never ends!” Mrs. Clinton’s decision to run for president comes as Mr. Trump continues to struggle to find a running mate willing to challenge him for the Republican nomination. Several candidates, including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker, have expressed interest in running. Some Republicans have speculated that Mrs. Clinton may want to stay out of politics until after the election. Others have questioned whether she can win over enough voters to overcome Mr. Trump’s formidable political organization. Still others have pointed to Mr. Trump’s personal history as evidence that he cannot be trusted to serve as a general-election candidate. In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has struggled to gain traction among African-Americans, many of whom view her as too inexperienced and insufficiently liberal. A poll last week showed her trailing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by double digits in black communities. For months, Mrs. Clinton has insisted that she has no intention of becoming a surrogate for Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. Now that he appears to be gaining momentum, Mrs. Clinton is taking steps to try to regain some footing. Last month, she held two town hall-style events in Pennsylvania, where she spoke at length about health care issues and paid a visit to one hospital. This past weekend, Mrs. Clinton hosted another event, which included questions from reporters, but did not address specific policy proposals. At both events, Mrs. Clinton spoke glowingly about President Obama and praised Hillary Rodham Clinton as a leader for women. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, also attended the second event. While Mr. Trump has yet to endorse a Democratic nominee, Mrs. Clinton has made clear that she intends to support Democrats in November. “The Clintons are going to go down as the greatest generation,” Mrs. Clinton told CNN last year, adding that she hoped the party would nominate a Democrat “who doesn’t just talk the way Donald Trump talks.” In a speech at West Point University in Virginia on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton said that she intended to “make sure that every single American gets access to quality education, opportunity and security.” “We need a government that works for everyone,” she said. “That’s why we need a commander in chief who understands our country’s role in the world, who cares deeply about our military families, and who believes passionately that America must lead in everything it does — including its economic and diplomatic relationships around the globe.” On Wednesday morning, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to hold a news conference in Washington, D.C., before flying to Florida. Mrs. Clinton said that she wanted to answer questions from reporters in advance of the trip. “I want to be prepared,” she said.",GPT-NEO,True,
