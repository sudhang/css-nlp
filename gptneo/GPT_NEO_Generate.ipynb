He was part of an extended conversation that had a touch of the sinister: The phone line went dead abruptly that first weekend from a line that he does not often talk on with people in the city’s gay enclave who find, despite Viennese government initiatives against that part of Vienna, that it contains enough gay population — almost 15,000 — still “to put us in hiding forever.” He is in Vienna’s public eye not only in that Viennese gay establishment of more than 1,400 places. His status is that his phone is now in use by others, and has no power to erase them from the map — he is, even after 24 straight hours in my life, just Mr. Binder the man. They go away one by one.

            "3:  VIENNA, Austria -  Austria passed an important law this month aimed at tightening control on the country’s telecommunications firms and giving companies access to private customer phone calls. Calling itself The Privacy International Federation and a body of the United States public telecommunications authority (incidentally, an affiliate of American telecoms industry giant AT&T) a body “working for citizens, not firms, in matters concerning individual customers and their privacy,” as well as having an international director — there could never have been more to celebrate — President Paul Mauskopf laid a major legislative victory at the inauguration of Chancellor Angela Merkel in June. The new law, which includes an expanded definition of what constituted wiretapping in 2015, allows consumers in Germany alone three years. Previously Austrian lawmakers had seen the number as six months, only because they lacked technical access to wiretap information and could, in other respects, rely to too much or far too narrowly for example, on their old cellphone numbers from last summer before it’s all reported or swept them under the internet again. Now AT&T said in legal testimony in recent days that one out of every 22 Austrian firms used intercepted data in ways for which, it hoped, at least 90 percent would be approved by parliament. Consumers’ trust? It may take some time, but some in politics may wish. Many customers are worried whether a law of such great significance could pass without much discussion across their country.

            "5:  VIENNA, Austria -  Pope Francis convened church synods and urged lawmakers to reject proposals for a sweeping plan to dismantle or even banish immigrants indefinitely from Ireland, arguing in interviews that lawmakers were not up to meeting tough public objections over the nation’s treatment of refugees.  Those positions come despite decades, if not millennia, of intense scrutiny on both the European migration crisis, more particularly its “catch-as-many-as-you-can-be-bitter as-you-can crowd” which has surged in recent weeks, as its sponsor migrants and their human rights have repeatedly clashed with elected Europeans over an unprecedented refusal for years to resettle any migrant who arrived as refugees in their nations by the Greek mainland as it waits to receive billions of dollars in aid. The Irish church says that Pope Paisles said it supports legal ways of admitting up to 10,000 asylum-seekers each year who request to move to safety, noting at meetings with parish priests in a tiny country in far Northwestern Ireland it represents nearly 1m Romanientans who call themselves in their religious language their “brothers-and-father” whose asylum status can no beyond as group and immigration conference — that a bishops expressed alarm in or or by thats bishops.

            "6:  VIENNA, Austria -  The United States and North Korea held dueling news conferences Saturday, neither seeking, perhaps acknowledging that it might get down to the drawing board for two decades before diplomatic wrangling was a more usual element in the diplomatic corps. Both men, from the South and China, came out from Saturday at high stakes that involved one of Europe’s most volatile nations — for both — and one whose status as No.2 nuclear supplier to six major allies is the most likely to turn around even this past century’s stalled Korean arms program of arms control agreements and missile talks. American presidents like Mr. Obama and their predecessors, Mr. Truman in the 1950s and President Trump in the eight years after 2010, may have given North Korea only praise or criticism, but to have one of their adversaries give that back up and declare it over the edge puts an American adversary back as high as one man or perhaps one side could climb into power at some date after 1945. No White House press release summed it up — no hint it ever went away — a North Korea missile “attack,” if indeed some North Korean troops were actually seeking one. No American press release ever suggested this latest event and the one before were one in the same nor did American officials in interviews, and the media reports on Sunday said Mr. Trump might even take off as much of a public feuding stance. “They’re one day apart, yet they have a lot\n",
            "7:  VIENNA, Austria -  Amid rising hysteria and a torrent  of death threats, more men began carrying small knives to Switzerland. On this busy bank in one of its three million branches,  members of the Austrian Jewish resistance, led by the group HOM.SE-SAID, began holding meetings. “How dare you attack Switzerland?!” read an initial notice one correspondent saw placed by the opposition at a public event where members of HOM.SE-SAID dressed as tourists dressed up to “forspeak of peace, love, brotherhood, solidarity against fascism and anti-colonial exploitation around the world and the human world in it that our Jewish sisters and friends struggle in.” That initial outrage  had spread as people held secret meetings on university campus, at coffee bars outside bars and with a friend, in parking spots — anything not covered by protective cuffs. Some did it publicly, some did after their phones began acting  all at once under surveillance,  sometimes when someone spoke. The next day HOM did it, when people stood in front of television cameras or began speaking online on the Internet to large crowds on Saturday evening as some anti Israeli propaganda sites published fake ads purporting that they said: “Jews in Palestine do not hate freedom!” Then they spoke to their own “peoples” groups  calling them the new Arab and Muslim versions of “peace” and “ tolerance” — which �\n",

An elderly Austrian refugee shouted for some help; it took a long minute for the man to finish his plea when the American medics came at last. The pair then began an 11-mile, two turn-about-trip and 15,000 block hike across fields planted at either corner with California almond tree cut flowers. Just past 6 a.m. on that January day in 2011 in La Jolla there had lived a Syrian-Turkish man named Mehmet Akçavay, also from Ethiopia and Syrian, who arrived from the eastern city of Aleppo just short after the end of combat. The area around an Orthodox church and cemetery filled with rubble; in many directions along the boulevard lay the twisted cars, twisted bodies, overturned storefronts, flattened streets. Yet Mehmet Akçavay was never forgotten as the site where two young medics working in a war zone helped transform a patient’s life with tiny surgery they described as “heart transplant miracle without any kind of operation” in 2010, a two-time Silver Coronavirus Relief Foundation grant-funded, multicase pilot at the San Francisco Bay area’s Mission Beach.

The villagers on their village greens and patios smiled and welcomed people into their quiet back pews. It was a celebration beyond even comprehension, the best and happiest gathering place anyone on vacation or business could find. And that is what most came here to witness, even those who might be the sort who never travel to the countryside or stay the week with his wife.

In this little Bavarian parish that is half Czech, about 10 blocks north, everyone in this quiet land where two rivers divide in the small village of Dohna was someone’s former neighbor when his children and colleagues were on vacation here more than 100 years ago and everyone came every year now: people you hardly knew if you don’t exist for just such an event, relatives living near enough (it was just the one in 2016) to have walked in off vacation with them and some new cousins along the walk from home; neighbors in nearby Gebbethnerkirchen who had traveled together since long before then.

Leaders of three nationalist allies and the French government said their paths were heading the right way again between a continent in the throes of wrenching strife with jihadists and mass refugees spilling across borders — in an echo or two of Mr Trump winning approval here last year as an America First foreign-military adventurist. Instead, at least in his adopted nation, Germany, where polls often find the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment, Chancellor Angela Meridional, who became one of Brussels aldermen last June and has repeatedly shown Mr Trump’s appeal can resonate, was left last with President Juncker of Europe a more united pair on Tuesday, his cabinet announcing the opening at home of his efforts for a refugee “reinacement” fund and a German-European migrant summit meeting that includes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. “In Berlin I heard, like my head, my voice thundering from a giant canyon, I wanted our European federal leaders to stop stupifying on this path by allowing uncontrolled and criminal immigrants into our countries where they could spread all kinds of diseases and where they could prey un sexually soinable females,in and on our democratic nations of with by, to, in it with to, Insolutions onto our wayward culture� by Mr. A and into an against us, the\n",

President Vladimir V. Putin of Vladimir, which straddles Europe and the Baltics on a peninsula in central Belarus and Russia, ordered Russia Military Secretary Alexander V.

A popular fixture for the Klotten Beer Club is a local tradition to find the best Belgian abacus for any combination of four letters, from \"Vlaamf,\" on the one hand, and “Löve” and perhaps some German Löse word-play for the last two, and turn “Vlambeer Bäbler abacus” into “Vienna Brewers Club abacus.\" While there’d otherwise already been thousands of entries, each worth more than the Austrian state could claim if it counted the foreign beers, which it will do during this week. Thousands more, like their namesake on Sunday night on the national selection to see which local brewer from this one city has built a reputation on creating uniquely different beers. That tradition took shape after local and regional officials created this selection from several categories (from “Austrian Lümmellekkebrasse” with four Belgian beers, a six-letter abacus, “Wannkammbrasse” for Belgian and one German ale) as part of the World Brewers Cup 2015 contest.

            "13:  VIENNA, Austria -  With ice cream and cherry cola in between every day life for 12 months has hit new highs at this popular Viennese restaurant. Across Europe ice cream is enjoying new momentum this year as ice cream’s rising popularity and abundance become a cause for jealousy here compared to what many see in the States. But because a little less ice cream is churned each month, sales, like those of milk in Vermont at the nearby Blue Vermont Cottage, reflect an emerging relationship as far beyond these borders: a little love for America. Nearly 100 Belgian families with German roots opened two ice cream makers in Austria, and the city of Augst fired on Thursday, after about 200 Germans and 200 Austrians signed a commitment of $50m of government financing to the venture. Some analysts doubt whether any more than 500 families will stay after two years’ operation - Austrian tourism has always tended low-density areas around resorts that require high travel. More German tourists, including retirees and students who take the children abroad, will bring attention on average to Europe as their influence in America declines and America loses. Mr. Nierznerschau said American competitors were looking at whether he could take up ice cream in markets like Argentina’s Newellesagræ and Argentina’s El Botic. Still, while ice cream might lose a percentage market share abroad through sheer quality of food, Austrian farmers will turn ice cream over and it is an organic and\n",

In 2013 at around midnight, after three months without any orders to do anything, the police forcibly evicted people at an isolated park that served the Austrian capital’s gay, sexually active populations, leading many people elsewhere at that time never knew how or when they had been taken for a march outside. In two of the most famous streets nearby, people have gone running and even been trampled: Schloss Oberwihnaufenberg from where King Karls Eitelgravar and the king of Bavaria lived; and Nachmittagsbostrom, now the house for gay people with a street in Schloss Hüklingen in Zellerbarkfeld which says there “were also children once”, according to its sign at Stammgraben 10A.

Television reporters huddle up in front coffee bars or the back rooms of theaters to ask the public about something and then broadcast them around the world. Most Central American countries aren’t really known for news broadcasting but they seem nonetheless committed to getting better: Some are sending a small crew and bringing cameras. Most television viewers tune out entirely of their viewing experience of television or television programs so they can hear real, unfiltered interviews with the reporters who came to speak on camera. On-the-fertral beaches or mountains with breathtaking panarotti forests seem to turn into a vermilion mirage: Even though this side of heaven, these people seem stuck: They speak with a stammer — barely the right words have gotten into their mouths and before the story time’s over, they mumble the hell right back — or ask the reporters questions in Spanish like these children speak Arabic when they have the microphone nearby for the broadcast they made last Wednesday: “And where in Chile would you travel to,” a student asking: She was asking about a hotel here last year that would let anyone bring in 10 pounds of luggage on Saturday as insurance for her brother- death. of the).

NATO was an armorer of war aims - first Russia in Russia's S.Ktrir, and then France last in Syria. The JNA-I is on this point along with President Boris Turchak. JNA countries became part of Serbia by the end of the late 1980’s on the recommendation from a secret council made up of Serbian generals; but NATO insisted on maintaining diplomatic “amboyalty” to the Serbian president at any diplomatic visit to these countries. In 2000 NATO became the sponsor of yet even wider support: for his policy, to which Dr. Bebica also has partial support for, this man who was already, until 2000, the most internationally powerful and wealthy politician in newly elected president Alexander survived a rerun primary for his vice minister nomination. The current secretary of his Serbian government, Milan Martic, supported both Mr. Pejić’s policies and the NATO intervention.- with butS — on some of Thesaturday he visited Skopje., Mr. NATO� to of\n",
            "17:  VIENNA, Austria -  Two men appeared early Monday with a giant boulder carved of shale in their pickup beds on Colorado, north of Salt Fork Valley. One wore desert camouflage and shades. His passenger on the road was bearded like that.  The rock appeared by morning after their snowplow rippled around them, so tall that it hid snow. Near the top grew a pair of sandalled feet, so it can no longer legally take that.  After they made one visit and two pickups stopped — snow, sun, ice-cream truck or other emergency stopping and fueling — all seemed like an episode of Cheers at Mountain Springs, as well as some of those shows “Dukes of Hazzard”: fast car, tight shot glasses; guns and a gunfighter. But as they neared a hill and turned toward the next spot, “the truck came alive,” Kevin, a 52-year-old realtor, testified on Jan. 9 before the Board No. 16 of a county of the 1somatoguy who runs this tourist county on the western slope a dozen or so miles and an extra 20 miles for the local park service. One woman got off from it. And another. Then the stone disappeared with four of its eight bricks with which it had replaced snow. “They were happy the truck ran. If we did a second run, they seemed even happier. ‘This stone works, we’\n",
            "18:  VIENNA, Austria -  Before the election came close to fruition for Italy more than 40 miles north this week in Toccoa, the country in this northwestern corner where immigrants arrive every month for the world’s deepest trade winds, Prime Minister Paolino Guiscari said his socialist party was offering solutions — one, in many ways, surprising — on his path to governing unchallenged. Yet when Prime Minister Sergio Mattarella, far back in another country that did things differently a quarter millennia ago, was suddenly removed without notice over an abuse of the party, some of their leaders accused one person of “spoils” or suggested an election run-by could leave their party at best a minority governing party in a government dominated by a center-right opposition that did not take its responsibilities seriously. There it was in fact just five years after one set of immigrants brought from Albania led what many were describing a sweeping Italian defeat that lasted until Mr. Mattarella and former Mayor Pietrasanta of Perugia took office and helped to install Italians to the top office of President Sergio Mattarella. Some accused an entire party as if a coup was unfolding in Toulouse against the state leader who did the equivalent of “we’re done” for the two-day conference a year ago which set its tone at a point for those around it. One group — an umbrella named New Tocca — made sure there were no questions from Italians and\n",
            "19:  VIENNA, Austria -  Prosecutors around a corner across Switzerland believe that they had little choice, with the suspect being a drug courier who was paid in bitcoin, and whose body language seemed to belie his guilt. The authorities said Tuesday they would investigate whether Switzerland’s banking secrecy laws played a role. “From the very moment they are told they have caught him in their jurisdiction or, rather, in our one, this is where they must detain him for seven days, under surveillance,” a police official working for prosecutors in a suburb north of Zurich said late Tuesday, adding “we are also continuing.” The investigation, prompted both by what appeared to be a lack of hard drug and firearms trafficking links from earlier in its drug investigations, followed several dozen men on vacation and their associates overseas for three nights, all well beyond a typical weeklong holiday: a break for a business trip, birthday presents and soccer games, according to local news reports, a birthday lunch on a nearby beach, shopping with young women on nearby town squares and watching other men doing business in coffee shops on nearby main streets. By Saturday, they had all disappeared, or possibly decided they couldn’t return to Austria. One of the dead men had not paid up the required amount of bitcoins required by authorities that evening to leave for a Swiss ski area at 10 o’clock in Vienna rather than continuing south like his wife, according to the Bernier public broadcaster, or a friend�\n"

The attacks on Friday night and early Saturday morning struck a busy commercial area in the heart of the capital, killing at least nine people and wounding at least 50 others, including many foreigners, they said. The attacks came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government was pushing to increase security in the country’s financial district. “The terrorists have come out of nowhere,” said Ashok Chatterjee, a professor of international relations at the University of Calcutta. “This is going to be one of the biggest terrorist strikes in history.” The police said it had arrested several suspects in connection with the attacks. The attackers, who are believed to have been members of an Islamist militant group, were also believed to be involved in a series of other bombings in recent years, including a bombing in New Delhi in 2013 that left 44 people dead. In addition to the bombings, the police said, they had found evidence of a plot to attack a train station in Guwahati, the capital of Assam, which has been hit by multiple bombs in recent years. The police said the suspect in Saturday’s attack, a resident of Kolkata, had been arrested. It was not clear if he was among those arrested. But Mr. Chatterjee said that while the police had been able to identify him from the photographs released by the authorities, they had not been able to do so from his face. “It is very difficult to identify someone from photographs,” he said. “It is very hard to tell whether you have seen this person before or not.” The police said that they had recovered the weapons used in the attacks and were investigating whether they could be linked to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. They said that the group had claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying it had carried them out because “Muslims are being targeted for their faith.” The police said that a man had been detained in connection with the attacks. They said that the man had been identified as a member of the same family as the suspect in the attacks, and that he had been in contact with him for some time. The police said that the man had been taken into custody, but did not elaborate. “We are still in the process of identifying the attackers,” said Superintendent of Police Rajeev Kumar. “We are still trying to establish the motive behind the attacks,” he said. “We have been working closely with the National Investigation Agency and other agencies.” The police said that the suspect had been arrested in Kolkata, about 200 miles northeast of the capital. He was being held in connection with the attacks. The police said that they had recovered the weapons used in the attacks and were investigating whether they could be linked to the Islamic State.

They said that the group had claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying it had carried them out because “Muslims are being targeted for their faith.” The police said that a man had been detained in connection with the attacks. They said that the man had been identified as a member of the same family as the suspect in the attacks, and that he had been in contact with him for some time. The police said that the man had been taken into custody, but did not elaborate. “We are still in the process of identifying the attackers,” said Superintendent of Police Rajeev Kumar. “We are still trying to establish the motive behind the attacks,” he said. “We have been working closely with the National Investigation Agency and other agencies.” The police said that the suspect had been arrested in Kolkata, about 200 miles northeast of the capital.

              "'Too often television news, especially on cable, serves as a megaphone for politicians who use it to forward lies and propaganda while so effortlessly ignoring questions they’re supposedly there to answer. But every now and then, there are those happy exceptions. . In the case of Donald J. Trump, the president-elect, the network has been one of them. On Wednesday night, CNN aired an hourlong special that, in a way, did not need to be aired. It was a rare moment of candor from a network that has long been known for its political bias. “The truth is that we don’t know what happened,” said CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was in Washington to cover the inauguration of President Trump. “We have no idea why he got elected. We have no idea why he became president. We have no idea why he’s a billionaire.” The special was an hourlong interview with Mr. Trump by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who had previously interviewed him for an episode of “New Day” on HBO. The special, called “The Briefing,” was a chance to discuss his campaign and the transition period leading up to the election. The president-elect, who was interviewed by CNN’s Jim Clancy, appeared at times to be more forthcoming than his advisers, who have insisted that he has not spoken about the transition period, saying only that he was “very excited” about being president. But the special also offered a window into the mind of someone who has spent his life trying to prove that he is fit to be president. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, told CNN that Mr. Trump had never discussed the transition period, but he did say that he would “love to” talk about it if the president-elect was willing. “I’m sure he will,” Mr. Giuliani said. “He’s very excited about it. He’s very excited about everything.” The special was a striking example of how the network’s political bias is not limited to its anchors. It was also a reminder that the network’s commitment to political correctness runs much deeper than just its anchors. A former CNN anchor, John King, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that the network’s decision to air the special was “a perfect example of how the network has become complicit in the culture wars,” and that it was “a disgrace to our democracy.” Mr. King said that Mr. Trump’s campaign, which had been criticized for its “unfairness,” was “the most dishonest campaign I’ve ever seen.” And he said that Mr. Trump’s remarks about the size of the crowd at his inauguration were “garbage.” “I can’t believe that this network would allow itself to be used as a platform for such garbage,” Mr. King wrote. “It’s beyond embarrassing.” Mr. Trump himself did not respond to requests for comment. But he has repeatedly denied that he has ever said anything derogatory about African-Americans or Jews. He has said that his campaign was “unfair” and that he would be “great” to debate Hillary Clinton. But he has also said that he does not support Israel’s right to exist and that he would be “great” to debate Barack Obama. He has said that he does not believe in evolution, but that he would debate Bill O’Reilly. But he has also said that he would debate Ted Cruz. And he has said that he would debate Bernie Sanders. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Marco Rubio, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who is a Republican running for re-election. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who is a Republican running for re-election. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who is a Republican running for re-election. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is a Republican running for re -election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Tim Pawlenty  of Minnesota, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is a Republican running for re-election. But the group’s leader, Rick Wilson, said he did not think that the other candidates were ready for prime time. “I don’t know why they haven’t been asked yet,” Mr. Wilson said. “It’s probably because they’re trying to figure out how to do their job. They’re trying to figure out how to get people excited about the campaign.” The group’s leaders have said that they want to make sure that the debates are as interesting as possible. But they have also said that they have to make sure that the candidates are prepared to answer questions and that the moderators are well versed in the issues. “If you’re going to be asking these questions, you have to know what you’re talking about,” said David Axelrod, the former adviser to President Barack Obama. “You have to know the context. You have to know the history. You have to know the political context.” Mr. Axelrod said that if the debates were held on Sunday evenings, he would be there, but he was not sure that the format would work. “I’m not sure we could get the audience,” he said. “We’d probably get a lot of people who are just going to be bored.” Mr. Ryan has said that he would like to debate the president, but he has said that he does not believe that he is ready. He has said that he has never been on a debate stage before. Mr. Pawlenty has said that he would like to debate the president, but he has said that he does not believe that he is ready. He has said that he has never been on a debate stage before. Mr. Walker has said that he would like to debate the president, but he has said that he does not believe that he is ready. He has said that he has never been on a debate stage before. The debate moderators have said that they want to make sure that the candidates are prepared to answer questions. But they have said that they want to make sure that the candidates are prepared to answer questions. “I think it’s important that we have a good moderator,” said Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, who is running for re-election. “I think it’s important that we have a good moderator.” In the past week, the debate moderators have asked more than 200 candidates to take questions from the public.
