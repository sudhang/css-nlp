"CHICAGO — Racism has contributed to a long pattern of institutional failures by the Chicago Police Department in which officers have mistreated people, operated without sufficient oversight, and lost the trust of residents, a task force appointed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel has found. The report, issued on Wednesday, was blistering, blunt and backed up by devastating statistics. Coincidentally, it was released as city leaders were installing a new, permanent superintendent for the Chicago Police Department. “C.P.D.’s own data gives validity to the widely held belief the police have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color,” the task force wrote. “Stopped without justification, verbally and physically abused, and in some instances arrested, and then detained without counsel — that is what we heard about over and over again.” The report reinforces complaints made for decades by African-American residents who have said they were unfairly singled out by officers without justification on a regular basis, then ignored when they raised complaints. It comes at a pivotal moment for the nation’s second-largest municipal police force, which is being criticized by residents and is under scrutiny from the Justice Department. And, coming from Mr. Emanuel’s own appointees, the findings intensify pressure on him and other Chicago leaders to make substantive, swift changes. The report makes more than 100 specific recommendations for change, and task force members called on the mayor and the City Council to take action. After formally receiving the report, Mr. Emanuel had no immediate public reaction. The task force amassed data that shows the extent to which African-Americans appear to have been disproportionately focused on by the police. In a city where whites, blacks and Hispanics each make up about one-third of the population, 74 percent of the 404 people shot by the Chicago police between 2008 and 2015 were black, the report said. Black people were the subjects in 72 percent of the thousands of investigative street stops that did not lead to arrests during the summer of 2014. Three out of every four people on whom Chicago police officers tried to use Taser guns between 2012 and 2015 were black. And black drivers made up 46 percent of police traffic stops in 2013. “The community’s lack of trust in C.P.D. is justified,” according to the report, a draft summary of which was first reported in The Chicago Tribune on Tuesday afternoon. “There is substantial evidence that people of color — particularly African-Americans — have had disproportionately negative experiences with the police over an extended period of time.” The stinging findings come at a particularly volatile time here, as violent crimes have increased this year and as police morale is reported to have sunk. Murders are up 62 percent this year compared with a year ago, Chicago police statistics show, and shootings have increased by 78 percent. Public pressure has remained intense. Just this week, after an officer fatally shot a black 16-year-old who the police said was armed, protesters took to the streets. The task force was given its assignment late last year, after the release of a graphic dashcam video showing a white Chicago police officer, Jason Van Dyke, fatally shooting a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, along a Chicago street. Widespread protests followed, and Mr. Emanuel fired the city’s police superintendent. He was officially replaced on Wednesday by the mayor’s choice, Eddie Johnson, a longtime Chicago officer who is black, grew up in a public housing project, and lives on the city’s South Side. In picking Mr. Johnson, Mr. Emanuel sidestepped a city requirement that he select a superintendent from finalists chosen by a police board, and the City Council unanimously approved the choice on Wednesday. The task force members were racially diverse, with professional backgrounds in social work, law and government. Lori Lightfoot, the president of the Chicago Police Board, an oversight group, was chairwoman, and the panel was advised by Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, who spent part of his childhood in Chicago. “What we heard from people all across the city is they felt like they didn’t even have a claim to the geography in front of their house, on their street, or in their neighborhoods,” Ms. Lightfoot said, as she presented the report at a downtown library. She acknowledged high rates of violence in some of those communities, but said that did not excuse abuses of power by the police, and that officers must be trained to fight crime while also respecting residents’ rights. The panel described the city’s delays in releasing the Laquan McDonald video and officials’ false descriptions of what had happened in the days immediately after that shooting as a “tipping point” for long-simmering anger. But “the linkage between racism and C.P.D.” had not bubbled up only after the McDonald video was made public, it said. Rather, Mr. McDonald’s death gave voice to years of unfair treatment, distrust within minority communities, and to “the deaths of numerous men and women of color whose lives came to an end solely because of an encounter with C.P.D.,” the report said. “The task force heard over and over again from a range of voices, particularly from African-Americans, that some C.P.D. officers are racist, have no respect for the lives and experiences of people of color and approach every encounter with people of color as if the person, regardless of age, gender or circumstance, is a criminal,” the report said, adding later, “These encounters leave an indelible mark.” “Even if there was no arrest,” it said, “there is a lasting, negative effect.” The report also condemned aspects of the city’s contracts with police unions, calling for changes to clauses that they said “make it easy for officers to lie in official reports,” ban anonymous citizen complaints and prevent the department from rewarding officers who turn in rule-breaking colleagues. The contracts, the task force concluded, “have essentially turned the code of silence into official policy.” The president of the union that represents rank-and-file officers did not immediately respond to interview requests. The report calls for dissolving the Independent Police Review Authority, which is charged with overseeing the most serious claims of police misconduct. The task force concluded that the authority has failed to investigate a large segment of its cases, rarely carries out meaningful discipline, and is perceived as favoring the police. It recommended that it be replaced with a “fully transparent and accountable civilian police investigative agency.” The report also calls for an expansion of the city’s body cam program; a unit assigned to handle issues around mental health crises; and a new deputy chief at the department in charge of diversity and inclusion. It also recommended putting in place a citywide reconciliation process in which the superintendent would publicly acknowledge the department’s history of racial disparity and discrimination and make a public commitment to change. The recommendations and the report drew praise for their candor, but some here remained doubtful about whether it would really bring widespread change. “The strong diagnoses must be followed by action — by the mayor, the City Council and the Police Department,” said Karen Sheley, police practices director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. “Corrective measures — those outlined by the task force and others — must be fashioned in a way that they cannot be reversed.” Charlene A. Carruthers, national director of Black Youth Project 100, a Chicago-based activist organization, said that she had not yet reviewed the report, but that she considered the task force “yet another example of the mayor’s office and those in power in the city of Chicago making decisions on behalf of the community.” Ms. Carruthers said increased civilian oversight and changes to police union contracts — two task force recommendations — were urgently needed. But, she added, “I do not have confidence that the task force or the mayor’s office will take bold enough steps.” On Wednesday, before the report was released, Mr. Emanuel said that his “general attitude” was to be “open to look at everything they say.” He met with members of his task force late in the day, but did not comment on the report afterward. Earlier in the day, Mr. Emanuel had said he wanted to work through the issues. “I don’t really think you need a task force to know that we have racism in America, we have racism in Illinois, or that there’s racism that exists in the city of Chicago and obviously could be in our department,” he said. He added: “The question is: What are we going to do to confront it and make the changes in not only personnel but in policies to reflect, I think, the values that make up the diversity of our city?”","CHICAGO — Racism has contributed to a long pattern of institutional failures by the Chicago Police Department in which officers have mistreated people, operated without sufficient oversight, and lost the trust of residents, a task force appointed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel has found.

The panel also said that the city should stop using so many cops for traffic stops, citing studies showing they were ineffective at reducing crime, while noting that such encounters disproportionately affect blacks. “The Chicago Police Department is not broken,” Mr. Emanuel declared at an afternoon news conference in City Hall. But he acknowledged that it had failed for decades to meet community needs. He pledged that his administration would work with Congress, state lawmakers and other officials to enact reforms and that he would submit legislation this month. Mr. Emanuel did not say what those changes might be. The mayor has been under intense pressure since last year’s release of video footage from dashboard cameras, body cams and surveillance videos showing excessive use of force against suspects. In January, after several days of protests over two fatal shootings involving unarmed young men, the president, Barack Obama, called Mr. Emanuel to urge him to take action, according to aides familiar with the conversation. On Tuesday, after the Justice Department announced that federal investigators had opened an inquiry into whether police engaged in unconstitutional practices, President Trump tweeted: “Chicago just agreed to spend nearly a billion dollars upgrading their very expensive equipment.” A few hours later, a group of protesters gathered outside City Hall. They chanted and held signs reading, “Racism kills” and “No justice no peace no racist policing,” as they marched toward Michigan Avenue. “It is a shame,” said Anthony Williams, 27, who lives near where Laquan McDonald died in October. “We need change. We’ve got to get rid of all these bad cops. It has to happen now. This can’t wait any longer.” In its final report, the Task Force to Review CPD Practices and Policies made a total of 46 recommendations, including the creation of a new civilian review authority and an independent inspector general office. It recommended changes that could include new rules governing when the public may record law enforcement actions; more training on deescalation techniques; and a ban on chokeholds, among others. In addition, the task force suggested a moratorium on hiring until the mayor could develop more rigorous screening procedures, and recommended that police commanders have greater latitude in assigning detectives, sergeants, lieutenants, captains and superintendents, rather than having them assigned based on seniority. The recommendations came in response to the killing last November of Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones, both teenagers shot dead during separate incidents with armed police responding to calls about mental health crises in predominantly Black neighborhoods in far northern Illinois suburbs of Rockford and Joliet. Both killings led to demonstrations in downtown Chicago and drew national attention. In the case of Ms. Jones, her family filed suit on Monday seeking damages and calling on Mr. Emanuel and City Council members to fire a sergeant, who is accused of lying about how she handled the situation. On Wednesday, Ms. Jones’s mother, Cleo Collins, joined by Mr. LeGrier’s father, Jonathan Watkins, and others, spoke out about their experiences in dealing with officers. They described being treated like criminals. They told stories of police using racial epithets and threatening violence. And they recounted how they felt powerless, unable to protect themselves from officers. Ms. Jones’s brother, Jonathan LeGrier, 19, said that his sister had bipolar disorder. She was taking medication that caused weight gain, which she tried to hide. When he went to visit her on Nov. 9, he saw that her bedroom door was locked. He knocked and asked if she needed help. “She didn’t answer me,” he recalled in an interview after the meeting with reporters, adding, “I thought she was sleeping.” He left and returned a short time later and again asked to come inside. Ms. Jones had taken off her clothes, and he noticed her breathing heavily. He said she seemed agitated. He went back home. Later, Ms. Jones left and drove away, according to police reports. Her parents reported that to dispatch, saying she might be suicidal. They called her cellphone repeatedly, and she answered once. Then she stopped answering her phone. At some point, police arrived and entered the house through the unlocked front door, and then through the garage door. They fired shots into the ceiling of Ms. Jones’s room. In a statement released by the office of Mayor Rahm Emanuel after Tuesday’s announcement, Mr. Watkins described what happened next: “They shot my daughter three times, twice in her chest, and once in her arm. I believe that they murdered her.” Police also arrested Mr. LeGrier, charging him with aggravated battery to police officers and resisting arrest, according to the Chicago Tribune, which reported the charges on Wednesday morning. The newspaper said Mr. Watkins was not charged because he had been acting as an agent for his daughter, who was mentally ill, when she called for help from police. But on Thursday morning, a spokeswoman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez told CNN that prosecutors were reviewing evidence, including video footage of the shooting that was captured on a neighbor’s cellphone camera. Mr. Watkins has declined repeated requests by reporters to discuss the incident. In his brief remarks, Mr. Watkins thanked the mayor for calling for an independent investigation into how Ms. Jones died, but said that it would be impossible to get justice through such means. He also criticized Mr. Emanuel, saying that he should have done more for the family of Laquan McDonald, another black teenager whose death at the hands of white officers sparked protests last year in the city. The Chicago Sun-Times quoted Mr. Watkins on Friday saying: “I don’t trust the system anymore.” He added that he believed Ms. Jones would never have gotten out alive if it had been up to the authorities to decide whether or not to charge anyone with wrongdoing. “She’d still be dead,” Mr. Watkins told The Sun-Times. The mayor and other officials had no immediate comment about the father’s statements, but Mr. Watkins said he was speaking on behalf of himself and his wife, Sandra Baskin-Watkins, who is black. The couple’s two children are both biracial, with one child being half African American, Mr. Watkins told CNN. In addition to his anger over Ms. Jones’s killing, he expressed frustration that her parents were unable to see their daughter before she was taken off life support and her body cremated. The police department said it did everything possible to accommodate them, including allowing them to view the body and take photographs of her wounds. Ms. Baskin-Watkins, in an interview with CNN affiliate WLS, also complained about not having access to her daughter’s medical records, even though police provided some information to Ms. Jones’s mother and brother. She said the family had filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the Police Department, but they had gone unanswered for months. She said her husband and son had gone to City Hall and met with the city clerk and others who promised to look into it, but nothing came of those efforts, either. “We want answers to our questions, but we can’t even find that out,” Ms. Baskin-Watkins told CNN. Mr. Emanuel said on Tuesday that he wanted to make sure there was transparency about the case and that he would do whatever he could to ensure justice is served. “The mayor and others have made clear we will hold people accountable, whether the person was wearing blue uniform or civilian clothes,” the statement read. Ms. Jones had moved back home to live with her family from college a few weeks earlier, after experiencing mental health problems there. Her mother had tried unsuccessfully to persuade her daughter to return to school in January 2015, after Ms. Jones dropped out, but eventually gave her permission to stay home and continue taking online classes, Ms. Baskin-Watkins said. On Dec. 20, Ms. Jones went back to visit friends in Austin. A week later, when she returned home, she seemed agitated and upset, the mother said. Her father took her out for dinner, then drove her home, where they argued. The mother left for work at about 1:30 a.m., leaving Ms. Jones alone with her brother, whom she often looked after while she worked or attended class, her mother said. At around 6:30 a.m. the following day, Ms. Baskin-Watkins received a call from a friend who told her that her daughter was bleeding profusely in bed and needed to go to an emergency room immediately. When Ms. Baskin-Watkins arrived at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, her daughter had already been pronounced dead, according to the hospital and family members. A doctor told her that Ms. Jones had suffered multiple gunshot wounds. The autopsy report found three bullet holes — one to her head and two in her right shoulder. Ms. Jones was struck at least twice by bullets fired from close range."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday backed off his threat to send the suspect in this week’s New York terrorist attack to the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but once again called for the man to be executed, a public intervention that could come back to haunt prosecutors in any future trial. In response to questions from reporters, Mr. Trump on Wednesday had said he would be open to transferring Sayfullo Saipov, the immigrant from Uzbekistan charged with plowing a pickup truck into passers-by in Manhattan and killing eight people, from the civilian justice system to the military system at Guantánamo. But after his offhand remark, aides sought to walk back the idea, saying it was merely notional. And the president was evidently briefed or saw something on television afterward about how the civilian courts have been more effective at convicting terrorism suspects than the troubled military tribunal system installed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The argument that Mr. Saipov should be tried in the same place where the terrorist attack that killed eight was committed mirrored the contention that President Barack Obama’s administration made when it sought to put Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, on trial in a civilian court in New York. But an uproar among city officials and business leaders at the time forced Mr. Obama’s Justice Department to abandon the plan and keep Mr. Mohammed at Guantánamo. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, chastised Mr. Trump for not declaring Mr. Saipov an enemy combatant so he might be interrogated for useful intelligence without worrying about any defendant rights embedded in the civilian judicial system. “I appreciate President Trump taking the gloves off when it comes to unleashing our military on ISIL,” Mr. Graham said, referring to the battlefield gains against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “However, I’m dumbfounded as to why the Trump administration still follows the Obama playbook when it comes to dealing with terror suspects.” That drew a retort from Vice President Mike Pence. “I got to tell you, there’s nothing about President Trump’s policies that mirror the last administration,” he told Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio. Skeptics of the military system were relieved by Mr. Trump’s turnabout. “It’s good that President Trump has realized that a prosecution of Saipov in federal court would be much faster and less legally complicated than sending him to Guantánamo for possible trial before military commission,” said John B. Bellinger III, a top White House and State Department lawyer under President George W. Bush. While Mr. Trump opted for a civilian handling of Mr. Saipov, the president’s call for capital punishment introduced a surprise complication that may burden prosecutors and help defense lawyers. Mr. Trump first broached the subject in a Twitter message posted shortly before midnight on Wednesday evening. Presidents are typically advised never to weigh in publicly on pending criminal cases. Such comments can be used by defense lawyers to argue that their clients cannot get a fair trial — especially when the head of the executive branch that will prosecute a case advocates the ultimate punishment before a judge has heard a shred of evidence at trial. But Mr. Trump is not one for cautious detachment, and he has disregarded such advice before. Just this week, a military judge said he would consider similar comments by Mr. Trump as evidence in favor of a lighter sentence for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to desertion and endangering fellow troops by walking away from his post in Afghanistan, where he was later captured and held prisoner by the Taliban for five years. Lisa Monaco, who ran the Justice Department’s national security division under Mr. Obama, said presidential comments “violate the golden rule” of independent law enforcement, could taint jury pools and call into question the rigorous process used to decide whether to seek the death penalty. “It doesn’t help the prosecutors,” she said. “It undermines the ability of the career prosecutors to do their job.” Other presidents have been criticized for offering public verdicts about pending criminal cases. In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon declared that Charles Manson “was guilty, directly or indirectly, of eight murders without reason” in the middle of his trial in the killings of the actress Sharon Tate and others. By the end of the day, the Manson team’s lawyers had moved for a mistrial, citing the president’s remarks, and Nixon issued what his press secretary called a “clarification” taking them back. “The last thing I would do is prejudice the legal rights of any person, in any circumstances,” Nixon said. The defendant later held up in court a newspaper with the headline “Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares.” But the judge allowed the trial to proceed, ultimately ending with a conviction. In 2005, Mr. Bush expressed confidence that Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the former Republican majority leader, would be acquitted, weeks before his trial on money laundering charges was to open. “I hope that he will, because I like him, and plus, when he’s over there, we get our votes through the House,” Mr. Bush told a television interviewer. His successor, Mr. Obama, forecast an execution for Mr. Mohammed, the Sept. 11 detainee. Defending the later-aborted decision to try Mr. Mohammed in civilian court rather than a military tribunal, Mr. Obama said critics would not find it “offensive at all when he’s convicted and when the death penalty is applied to him.” The impact of such comments is more pronounced in military justice cases since the president is the commander in chief of the judges and juries that determine guilt or innocence and hand down sentences. Responding to a wave of sexual harassment allegations in the military, Mr. Obama declared in 2013 that troops who commit sexual assault should be “prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged.” In this instance, he was not commenting on a particular defendant, but lawyers nonetheless argued that it constituted “unlawful command influence.” Such influence refers to actions by commanders that could be seen as an attempt to sway a court-martial. Defense lawyers in multiple cases cited Mr. Obama’s words. In one case in South Carolina, a judge noted the command influence issue in dismissing sexual assault charges against an Army officer. In another in Hawaii, a Navy judge decided that two defendants could not be punitively discharged because of the president’s comments. Mr. Trump has more than once offered strong words about people suspected of major crimes. He called the man who opened fire on a concert in Las Vegas last month a “very sick man” and “a very demented person,” but since the man killed himself, there will be no trial to influence. On Wednesday, he called Mr. Saipov “this animal.” As a candidate, Mr. Trump was unflinchingly vocal about Sergeant Bergdahl, calling him a “dirty rotten traitor” who should be executed. A military judge in February called the comments “disturbing and disappointing,” but decided that since they were made when Mr. Trump was a private citizen, not the president, they did not constitute undue command influence. Mr. Trump was more restrained when asked about Sergeant Bergdahl’s case last month, but not so much that it did not come up in court. “I can’t comment on Bowe Bergdahl,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden. “But I think people have heard my comments in the past.” After concerns were raised about the “but” in his comment, the White House sought to mitigate any possible damage with a statement. “The president expects all military personnel who are involved in any way in the military justice process to exercise their independent professional judgment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations,” the statement said. Col. Jeffery R. Nance, the Army judge presiding over the case, rejected a request to dismiss the case or limit the potential sentence because of Mr. Trump’s remarks, saying he had not been influenced. But he indicated that he would weigh the president’s comments before determining punishment. “I will consider the president’s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,” he said. Mr. Bellinger, the former Bush White House lawyer, noted that the Bergdahl case had already resulted in one White House statement walking back the president’s words. “The White House,” he said, “may now need to issue a similar statement with respect to a federal prosecution of Saipov.”","WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday backed off his threat to send the suspect in this week’s New York terrorist attack to the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but once again called for the man to be executed, a public intervention that could come back to haunt prosecutors in any future trial.

Bay, where detainees are held without access to lawyers or trials by jury. But after meeting privately for more than an hour Thursday morning with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has long advocated sending terrorism suspects there, and White House aides including Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, who have also pushed to use it as an alternative to criminal courts, Mr. Trump reversed course, saying in a statement: “We will seek out additional resources necessary through our government agencies to prevent these horrible acts of violence.” The president did not say what those additional resources might be. He added: “I am asking Congress to develop legislation allowing us to bring really bad dudes home fast!” Mr. Trump also tweeted about the case Thursday afternoon. The president, who is known to watch cable news shows like Fox News Channel and MSNBC, was clearly influenced by their coverage, which included calls by some commentators for Guantánamo as well as criticism of his decision. “The only reason I didn’t do it is because we need strong border security,” Mr. Trump told the network’s Sean Hannity in an interview broadcast Thursday night. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, explained the reversal by citing concerns among senior administration officials about how a transfer of custody from federal court to Guantánamo would play politically. She also noted that the Justice Department was still considering whether to pursue the death penalty against the defendant. The Justice Department declined to comment. In his tweet, Mr. Trump seemed to embrace the idea of executing terrorists in general and not just those captured overseas. “If they kill innocent Americans,” he wrote, “they should DIE! No games.” Mr. Sessions said Thursday night on CNN that he supported using Guantánamo, but only if Congress authorized its reopening and provided money and other support for prosecuting cases there. Mr. Sessions added that it would take time and effort to set up such a facility and said it might take years before a detainee convicted in civilian court and sentenced to life imprisonment there would actually arrive there. Mr. Saipov has been indicted in Federal District Court for murder and weapons charges stemming from Tuesday’s rampage and faces possible execution. His lawyer has asked to move the proceedings from Brooklyn and said he planned to plead insanity. Prosecutors said he appeared calm and lucid during questioning, which took place on Thursday, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter but spoke anonymously because they were not allowed to discuss details publicly. One official described him as appearing to understand what was happening around him, though another cautioned that Mr. Saipov, a naturalized United States citizen born to Muslim parents, may not fully grasp why he has become so controversial so quickly. In addition to Mr. Saipov, three others died, along with four police officers responding to reports of shots fired near Times Square. A total of 11 victims were wounded in all, five critically. Mr. Sessions also met on Thursday morning with Representative Peter King of Long Island and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, both Republicans, as part of a bipartisan push for tougher gun control measures, and then traveled to Capitol Hill to meet privately with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Both Republican leaders expressed concern about how the suspect obtained guns used in the shooting, but neither indicated any willingness to change existing laws. In remarks afterward, Mr. Trump appeared to acknowledge the difficulty of passing new restrictions in light of opposition to them by many conservatives. But the president said he believed in doing something. “You know, you can talk forever. You can go on talking and on debating,” he said. “But eventually you have to make decisions, right? And we have to get tough, folks, because otherwise there’s no way.” Mr. Trump, whose own rhetoric often includes inflammatory language against immigrants and Muslims, said he had been surprised that Democrats like Mrs. Clinton and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom she defeated last year, were reluctant to condemn her rival. “Hillary said nothing and Joe Biden didn’t even want to mention Hillary’s name,” Mr. Trump said. “They don’t know what to think, but I’ll tell you one thing: They better start thinking very rapidly as far as being soft-pedaled goes. Because this country doesn’t feel safe anymore. We don’t have borders. Our military isn’t ready.” — By Michael Sallah, Maggie Haberman, Nicholas Fandos, David Ewing Duncan, Jim Dwyer, William Kole and Ashley Southall.

All rights reserved.. The Times Company (NYSE: NYT) is a media conglomerate that owns the New York Times, which has been in business since 1851. It also publishes other newspapers and magazines. The company's stock price was trading at about $9 per share on Friday morning, down from its high of more than $55 in late 2007. It closed on Thursday at $8.80. The company is owned by shareholders who are not affiliated with The New York Times or any other news organization. The New York Times Company owns about half the shares outstanding and controls most of its voting power. Its largest shareholder, as well as its biggest individual investor, is Michael Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg bought about 10 percent of the Times' stock, according to regulatory filings, for $5 million, making him one of its top investors. He holds $50 million worth of company stock today, and he has pledged to give it all away when he dies, to be split among his children. The company owns 100 percent of the voting rights. The Times Company has no debt or preferred stock outstanding. The Times' stock trades on a secondary market called Nasdaq Global Select Market, where companies can raise capital through initial public offerings. The Times went public in 1980, but Mr. Bloomberg did not buy into the offering until 1994, after it had already gone up significantly in value. In that period, the company raised more than $400 million by selling new shares. Mr. Bloomberg has said that he has never sold any of his holdings, even though they have appreciated greatly over time. His stake now has an estimated market value of $500 million. Mr. Bloomberg said that if he were ever forced to sell some or all of his stock holdings, it would only happen because the Times Company needed the money. But if he chose to do so voluntarily, it would probably not happen until the end of his life. That means, according to Mr. Bloomberg, that if he decided to retire or die in the next few years, the sale could take place in the middle of the year. If he did decide to sell some of his stake in the coming months, Mr. Bloomberg said, it could happen only if the company’s board approved such a move, as he does not want to make decisions without consulting them first. “I don’t think I will,” Mr. Bloomberg said of selling any shares, adding that he does not plan on retiring anytime soon. In addition to owning the company’s shares outright, he also holds options for another 1.3 million. Those shares represent 2 percent of his total stake, according to filings. In 2011, when the company reported earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, he told reporters he planned to hold onto the company’s shares for many years."
"“We, the members of this grand jury, need you to hear this,” begins the nearly 900-page report released Tuesday by a grand jury that spent two years investigating reports of sexual abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church over a period of 70 years. The report, which says there were more than 1,000 identifiable victims and perhaps thousands more, is the broadest examination yet by a government agency in the United States of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Here are some excerpts.  The grand jury members documented a wide variety of abuses by priests and others within the church, as well as creative ways of covering up or denying accusations. “Even of those odious stories, some stood out,” the report reads.  Those cases include a priest who the grand jury says raped a 7-year-old girl while visiting her in the hospital after she got her tonsils out. Another priest made a 9-year-old boy give him oral sex, “then rinsed out the boy’s mouth with holy water to purify him.” [Read about the grand jury investigation and the church’s ‘playbook for concealing the truth.’] The grand jury used strong language to hold leaders of the church accountable for enabling and protecting the abusers.  Church leaders frequently protected and sympathized with the abusers, not their victims, the report states.  One of the cases that the grand jury reports on in great detail involves the Rev. Edward R. Graff, who served as a priest for 45 years, including 35 in the diocese of Allentown. During his years in ministry, Father Graff raped scores of children, the grand jury report says.  The church had documented numerous reports of Father Graff’s abuse over the years, the grand jury report says, and yet when they came to light publicly, the church downplayed and denied its knowledge. In 2002, Father Graff was arrested in Briscoe County, Tex., where he had continued his ministry, for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy, the grand jury report says. He died of injuries from an accident while in a Texas prison awaiting trial.  Another case documented by the grand jury involved a priest in the Harrisburg diocese who was accused of abusing many members of a large family in his parish during the 1980s.  The grand jury reported that it had uncovered a ring of predatory priests in the Pittsburgh diocese who “shared intelligence or information regarding victims,” created pornography using the victims, and exchanged victims among themselves. “This group of priests used whips, violence and sadism in raping their victims,” the report states. “George still has the cross and it was shown to the grand jury,” the report states.","“We, the members of this grand jury, need you to hear this,” begins the nearly 900-page report released Tuesday by a grand jury that spent two years investigating reports of sexual abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church over a period of 70 years. The report, which says there were more than 1,000 identifiable victims and perhaps thousands more, is the broadest examination yet by a government agency in the United States of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.","“We, the members of this grand jury, need you to hear this,” begins the nearly 900-page report released Tuesday by a grand jury that spent two years investigating reports of sexual abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church over a period of 70 years. The report, which says there were more than 1,000 identifiable victims and perhaps thousands more, is the broadest examination yet by a government agency in the United States of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.. It lays out an extraordinary catalogue of cover-ups, including at least one case where church officials paid off victims with settlements rather than reporting them to law enforcement officials. In addition to detailing decades of alleged crimes, it also describes how bishops, priests, nuns and other religious leaders conspired to keep their misdeeds secret. And, perhaps most strikingly, the grand jurors say they believe that Pope Francis knew about allegations against Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in New York but did not act on them until after he was forced to resign last year. The report is based on testimony from witnesses who have been interviewed under oath over a span of nearly a decade, as well as documents obtained through subpoenas, civil lawsuits and court records. The report’s release comes amid growing calls for accountability within the American hierarchy of Roman Catholics following revelations in recent months of widespread clergy sex abuse of children in several countries. But its findings are especially damning because it details not only what happened to hundreds of people, many of whom remain unidentified, but also what appears to be a deliberate effort to conceal those abuses and protect abusers from prosecution. The report was issued on behalf of the Altoona–Johnstown Diocese of Bishop Mark Bartchak by a jury drawn from Blair County. In his introduction to the document, the grand juror, John J. Vican Jr., writes: “The purpose of our investigation was not to assign blame or apportion guilt.” Instead, he said, the goal was to determine whether any laws had been broken and “to identify and address the root causes that allowed these terrible acts to occur.” He added, “Our investigation has shown us that those causes were systemic throughout our diocese, our nation and beyond.” Mr. Vican also wrote that he believed Pope Benedict XVI had known about accusations that Father Lawrence Cionni abused boys while serving as pastor at St. Joseph Parish in Hollidaysburg, Pa., beginning in the late 1970s. The pope resigned from public life in February 2013, citing health concerns. A spokesman for the Vatican declined to comment on Tuesday. Bishop Bartchak told reporters he would read through the report before making further comments about how his diocese will respond to it. A spokeswoman for Bishop David Zubik, head of the Pittsburgh diocese, told reporters on Tuesday that she had just received the document, so it was too soon to know how it might affect her diocese, which includes 10 counties in western and central Pennsylvania. She said, however, that her office was already working on a plan for dealing with past cases and future ones. “I can tell you we take very seriously all matters related to protecting minors and vulnerable adults,” Ms. Dinniman said. “We want to do everything possible to prevent such behavior in our parishes and schools and ensure anyone harmed receives help and healing.” Bishop Bartchak has previously acknowledged that he failed in some instances to follow proper procedures when handling complaints of priest misconduct. “It’s very clear from what I see here that I didn’t handle things correctly,” he told CNN affiliate WTAE. “And I apologize for that and ask forgiveness of anybody I may have hurt or disappointed.” Bishop Bartchak is now retired and living in Florida. His predecessor in the Altoona diocese, Archbishop Anthony Mankelka, died in 2007, according to diocese records, though Bishop Bartchak said that he did not learn that fact until recently. Mr. Vican and two fellow grand juror, James E. O’Hara and Thomas P. Quigley, both lawyers who live in Pennsylvania, spoke to reporters outside a courthouse here. They described the process they went through and explained why the grand jury decided not to indict Cardinal Donald T.Wuerl, then bishop of Washington. He became archbishop of Philadelphia and cardinal emeritus of Washington last month, the first time a U.S. prelate held those titles simultaneously. Mr. Vican, 58, was born and raised in Altoona and attended high school there before going on to earn degrees at Penn State University and Duquesne University School of Law. A former prosecutor, he worked in private practice for many years before becoming an assistant district attorney in Cambria County in southwestern Pennsylvania. He later served in various roles for the state Department of Corrections, the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, the Blair County District Attorney’s Office, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and as chief counsel to Governor Tom Corbett. In his role as chief legal officer, Mr. Vican oversaw a team that investigated allegations against clergy members who sexually assaulted and molested more than 100 young victims. That work led him and the grand jury to conclude that the Altoona Diocese was rife with problems for many years. The grand jurors found evidence, among other things, that Cardinal Bernard F alsely claimed he had no knowledge of sexual abuse in the diocese and that Bishop Joseph Adamec, then bishop of Johnstown, had failed to protect children from known abusers. Mr. Vican said the investigation was not limited to the Diocese of Harrisburg, but also included other Catholic organizations and institutions in the state. He said that the grand jury’s findings were based on interviews and documents obtained through subpoenas, including “thousands of pages” from a confidential list that was given to the grand jury by victims, which contained names of priests accused of abusing minors. Mr. Vican, a graduate of Penn State University’s Dickinson School of Law, is married with three grown sons. and has lived in State College for more than 30 years. He said the grand jury’s report would be made public at some point after it is reviewed by prosecutors for any potential legal action against those named. The grand jury, formed by Judge William Eshbach in June 2016, issued its final findings after reviewing evidence gathered over the course of several months. It concluded that there was sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to indict two men who worked as teachers or counselors in schools run by the Roman Catholic Church. One man is charged with sexually assaulting one boy, while another faces charges related to “sexual contact” with a second victim. Both are former employees of St. Pius X High School in Altoona. A third person charged is the Rev. James J. Brennan, pastor of Our Lady Help of Christians Parish, an Erie church where Mr. Vican once served on its parish council. A fourth individual, identified only as an employee of a school run by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, was indicted for allegedly possessing child pornography. All four have pleaded innocent. A fifth defendant is awaiting trial in Blair County Court after being charged with indecent exposure in connection with allegations that he exposed himself to students in 2012 and 2013. The report says that the abuse occurred between 1960 and 2009, when Bishop Anthony Gualtieri led the Harrisburg diocese. It does not name specific parishes or dioceses that may have been involved. But the grand jury found that there had been an effort to conceal information about abuse within the church in order to avoid scandal. In addition, it said that some bishops and others knew about allegations of abuse and did nothing about them. The report makes clear the scope of the problem and how widespread sexual abuse was. It states that 37 people abused children in Pennsylvania alone between 1947 and 1991. Of that number, 26 cases of clergy abuse occurred between 1960 and 1988. It says there are at least 26 victims. In his statement on Tuesday, the bishop apologized again for what happened to the boys. He added, however, that he could offer little else beyond those words, because of confidentiality laws that prevent him from discussing details of specific victims or their families. Mr. Vican said the report did not include all the facts and figures he wanted to see included in a full accounting. But he added, “I think we can say, without equivocation, that this report shows a systemic cover-up of abuse in our churches.” He said that the diocese had already taken steps to address the issue, including the creation of new policies to ensure that employees undergo background checks before they work in the parish system, as well as mandatory training in recognizing signs of child sexual abuse and reporting such incidents to law enforcement officials. He added, “We will continue to take every possible step to make sure the safety of all parishioners, especially children and youth, is paramount in everything we do as an institution of faith.” In response to questions, the Rev. Edward Maleski, vicar general for Bishop Lawrence Persico of Altoona, issued a brief written statement saying, “The report has no bearing on our current practices.” The Rev. James Cawley, spokesman for the Pittsburgh archdiocese, declined comment. The dioceses in Scranton, Greensburg and Lancaster said they could provide only statements similar to the ones released on behalf of Bishop Adamec, whose resignation was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. Mr. Vican said the grand jury had found a pattern in diocesan behavior. “They found that this is systemic,” he said. “It wasn’t just one bad apple; there are many.” Mr. Vican said the diocese would now face scrutiny as part of civil lawsuits filed by alleged victims against the Catholic Church. “This isn’t going away,” he said."
"WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority. “Oh, Drumstick, I think, is going to be very happy.” It ended with characteristic introspection. “I feel so good about myself,” the president said softly, appraising his own clemency, laying a hand on the bird after seeking permission to touch it from turkey professionals. Mr. Trump looked upon the crowd in the Rose Garden and announced his decision: The animal was hereby pardoned for the crime of being born a turkey. Such was Mr. Trump’s inaugural take on a Washington tradition that seems to exist mostly because it existed the year before, a sort of “Apprentice” for the long-necked set, superimposed on the White House for a statelier feel. “Very special people, a very special country,” Mr. Trump summarized, a bit mechanically, before heading off to Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday. Yet if some presidents have slogged through the more ceremonial elements of the office — grimacing through regrettable puns written by aides, counting the seconds until they could return to federal duties that did not include standoffish poultry — Mr. Trump appeared perhaps more comfortable than usual, unburdened by forces beyond his jurisdiction. So much of the job has frustrated him, by his own account. He cannot intervene in Justice Department affairs, he has lamented. He cannot browbeat lawmakers into affirming his agenda. Here is something he can control: This turkey lives. Other turkeys die. It is so ordered. “They say, ‘Enough talk,’” Mr. Trump said at one point, imagining an internal monologue for Drumstick and a peer, Wishbone, who was apparently spared off-camera. “‘Please pardon us.’” For about eight minutes, Mr. Trump seemed to forget about Russia-tinged investigations, about congressional gear-grinding, about college basketball players (or the relatives of college basketball players) showing insufficient gratitude for his efforts. He marveled at the size of Drumstick (“Thirty-six pounds — that’s a big bird”), admired the animal’s appearance (“beautiful turkey”), praised the spot where the turkey would settle (“Gobbler’s Rest, beautiful place”) and the university that houses it (“Virginia Tech, tremendous school”). He mentioned Pennsylvania without interrupting himself to note that he had carried the state in a surprise result last year. He joked that he had been advised against seeking to reverse the pardons of Tater and Tot, the last turkeys given their reprieve under President Barack Obama. “As many of you know, I have been very active in overturning a number of executive actions by my predecessor,” Mr. Trump said. “However, I have been informed by the White House Counsel’s Office that Tater and Tot’s pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked.” Mr. Trump has stocked his tenure with disarming moments of presidential pageantry, often infusing photo ops with such telling asides: complaining about the news media to the Halloween-costumed children of the news media; looking into an eclipse without protective eyewear because he could not resist; sliding behind the wheel of a giant truck on the White House lawn because it seemed like fun. And with Mr. Trump, subtext often has a way of becoming text. There was at least some expectation on Tuesday that he might let fly an ill-conceived groaner about the wisdom of retaining a pardon or two for later, with a special counsel inquiry shadowing his administration. That was not to be. Flanked in the Rose Garden by his wife, Melania, and his youngest son, Barron — with a guest list that also included his daughters Ivanka and Tiffany and his son-in-law Jared Kushner — Mr. Trump wished American families well, thanked military and law enforcement personnel and approached the animal. “Are you ready, Drumstick?” he asked. “O.K.?” He pardoned the bird and began clapping at his act. Others followed. Drumstick began gobbling a bit, tilting its neck back to take it all in. Mr. Trump turned to shake a few hands, when a shout pierced the low hum of pleasantries. “Are you going to pardon any people?” cried a voice near the back, beside a row of cameras. The president smiled, and kept on shaking.","WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority.","WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority. : pardoning two turkeys at the White House for Thanksgiving dinner. But as the president stepped up to the lectern and pulled back his right arm to deliver the traditional presidential pardon to one turkey and then another, a commotion broke out in the crowd behind him. A woman wearing an orange knit cap, her face obscured by sunglasses, began shouting at the top of her lungs. The Secret Service agents who were there quickly rushed over to escort the protester away. As they did so, she continued to scream and shout. Then a man began yelling in response, saying that “Trump is not my president.” And then another person started chanting in protest of the pardons: “No justice! No peace!” “Hey hey ho ho Donald Trump has got to go!” That last chant was repeated again and again. As it went on, a small group of protesters gathered outside the fence surrounding the South Lawn, holding signs. One read: “Pardon me? I don’t want your turkey.” Another said: “Thanksgiving is about family, friends and food not hate and fear.” But inside, the scene was far less chaotic than what unfolded in front of the cameras. Afterward, some people said that the commotion had been orchestrated. Others insisted it was spontaneous, but that the agents should have known better than to let someone into such close proximity of Mr. Trump. Still others wondered if there was any truth at all to the idea that a planned demonstration was taking place outside. (The Trump campaign denied the existence of any organized protests.) For many Americans, this year will mark their first time observing a holiday without George W. Bush or Barack Obama in charge. In recent years, both presidents had used their annual pardoning power as opportunities to highlight causes dear to them and honor individuals who exemplified those values. But with Mr. Obama leaving office last Friday and with no successor yet elected to replace him, there was little reason for anyone in Washington to expect anything different from the current administration, which has made clear its disdain for much of President Obama’s legacy. So when word spread on Monday evening that the two birds would soon meet their fate, it seemed like just another example of how little things are likely to change under the new regime. The two male gobblers had already spent more than six months living on borrowed time, having survived the first round of presidential clemency in January and the second round in October. They had also endured a long journey to get there, flying all the way from Minnesota’s Le Sueur County before being transported by motorcade to the National Turkey Federation headquarters near Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning. There, the turkeys had met the other two members of their species in residence: Butterball and Nugget, two female hens from North Carolina that have lived together since last summer. In addition to the turkeys’ names and genders, there was a third fact about these three that the public might find surprising: All three have had their own Twitter accounts. The two male turkeys had more followers, about 15,000 each, while Nugget has only around 2,500 followers, according to a spokeswoman for the turkey federation, Julie DeYoung. Butterball was ineligible to tweet because of federal regulations governing poultry production. Ms. DeYoung, the turkey federation spokeswoman, said she was unaware of the accounts until after they appeared online on Monday night. She added that she believed that the turkeys themselves had created the accounts and said the organization would investigate whether there were violations of any rules regarding government employees using social media accounts to promote political messages. “We will look into whether the accounts violated any laws and policies, including ethics,” Ms. DeYoung said. “If we determine any violation occurred, appropriate action will be taken, consistent with our mission to support agriculture, education, research, and community outreach programs.” The pardons themselves were a relatively straightforward affair, although the White House press secretary Sean Spicer did manage to make some news himself. He announced that Mr. Trump was granting a full 50-pound reprieve for Gobbler Number Two. The president also granted a 40-pound reprieve for Number Three, but Mr. Trump did not announce what the bird weighed. “I think that the president has done something very good today for all turkeys, including those two who are here in attendance,” Mr. Spicer told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. He added, however, that “the turkeys will still end up getting eaten” by millions of families across the country. Mr. Trump did not mention the protesters during his remarks, nor was he asked any questions about the incident by journalists covering him. Instead, Mr. Spicer focused his attention on what Mr. Trump called “a great day for America, a great day for freedom.” But Mr. Spicer, too, did not seem entirely sure of how to respond. He said that he was still trying to understand the details of what had happened in Charlottesville and said he would have more information later in the afternoon. Mr. Spicer’s comments came as President Obama issued an impassioned statement condemning white supremacists and neo-Nazis who were protesting against removing Confederate monuments from public spaces, saying they had no place in American society and calling them domestic terrorists. The president also condemned those who opposed their removal and called their actions reprehensible. He also praised law enforcement officials in Virginia, where two state police officers died after being struck by vehicles during protests over the weekend, for protecting protesters from violence. In his remarks, Mr. Trump also took aim at the news media. “We are living through very difficult times,” he said. “The level of dishonesty is out there like never before. I don’t know if it has ever been this bad before.” In the days since Saturday’s rally in Charlottesville, which left one person dead after clashes between counterprotesters and supporters of Confederate statues erupted into violent confrontations, the White House has struggled to explain why it initially seemed reluctant to condemn white nationalists or disavow groups with ties to racism and anti-Semitism. On Monday morning, as the administration faced growing criticism, the president tweeted: “I am pleased that my statements yesterday made clear that we must all come together as Americans for peace and harmony.” In response to the president, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, tweeted, “Mr. President, you can say whatever you want to try to distract us, but your words matter.” And Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democratic member of the intelligence committee investigating Russia’s interference in last year’s presidential election, wrote: “If the President doesn’t believe Nazis should be denounced, then he shouldn’t be our Commander in Chief.” On Tuesday afternoon, as he departed Washington en route to New Jersey, President Trump told reporters he believed he had done enough, and that it was time to move forward. Asked whether Mr. Spicer had adequately explained his initial reluctance, he replied, “No,” adding, “But that was a long answer. That wasn’t short, right?” “It was not good.” “You could see when people got up and started talking — I think he handled himself well,” Mr. Trump added. “He knows exactly what happened. It wasn’t hard for me to figure out, because you saw some pretty rough stuff. You know what happened? We didn’t get along so well. We weren’t getting along.” In his first appearance as press secretary, Sean M.Spicer, who worked closely with Mr. Trump in the campaign and transition period, had seemed ill prepared for the job, unable to provide basic answers on the most pressing issues facing the country and struggling to convey even simple messages clearly. But he had appeared confident and comfortable when speaking to reporters in recent weeks about Mr. Trump’s agenda and policy proposals, including health care legislation that failed in Congress earlier this month, and had been able to deflect most inquiries about Mr. Trump and other controversies by pointing out how poorly former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton performed under similar circumstances as she sought the presidency. At a briefing at 2 p.m., Mr. Spicer seemed more relaxed than usual and more forthcoming. He acknowledged the difficulty of explaining why the president seemed hesitant to denounce hate crimes committed in his name and said Mr. Trump was working with aides to craft a message that reflected the full range of the nation’s political spectrum. “There’s no question that we need a better way to communicate to make sure the entire country understands that he unequivocally condemns these acts and everything else that goes on with hatred,” Mr. Spicer said. But he was less certain about why it took Mr. Trump so long to speak out against the white nationalist demonstrators. “He’s going to continue to work with members of both parties, both sides, and see how best he can unify us as a country,” Mr. Spicer said, adding, “This isn’t something he wants to talk about every single day. This was something where he felt strongly.” Asked what Mr. Trump thought when he heard the chants of the crowd on television, Mr. Spicer responded: “That’s what we need to find out. That’s what the investigation will tell us.” “But that doesn’t mean you should just jump to conclusions,” he said."
"His victims call him the Butcher of Bosnia. His defenders say he was a nationalist trying to defend his people as Yugoslavia collapsed. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb general, was convicted of war crimes on Wednesday over the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s — Europe’s worst massacre since World War II. His trial, which began in 2012, was the last to be handled by the United Nations war crimes tribunal set up in response to the atrocities. Here are some in-depth articles from The Times’s archive about the man who shaped the image of the Balkans in war and in peace: A Times correspondent profiled Mr. Mladic in 1994, as the general and Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, became increasingly isolated in their rejection of an international peace plan for Bosnia. “Mladic’s first name, Ratko, is a diminutive of Ratimir (War or Peace) or Ratislav (War of Slavs). Ratko is a name typically given a male baby in wartime. The general, 51, refuses to be identified in any way with the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, created in April 1992 as an independent and multiethnic state and recognized by the United States and the European Community.” Forces led by Mr. Mladic kept Sarajevo, Bosnia’s capital, under a deadly siege for nearly four years. Some troops shelled their own homes in the city. Thousands lived in fear during those years, facing the daily threat of being hit by snipers. More than 10,000 people died on all sides. That was the promise made by Mr. Mladic on July 12, 1995, as he gently patted a young boy on the head in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. His bodyguards handed out chocolates to children. It was a lie. Over the next 10 days, his soldiers hunted down, captured and summarily executed more than 8,000 men and boys from the town. In 2011, Times correspondents wrote that mass killings were a trademark of Mr. Mladic and that they ultimately caused his downfall. After an international accord was reached to make peace in Bosnia in 1995, Mr. Mladic spent much of his time isolated in a mountain bunker surrounded by a coterie of officers. His moods were said to swing from rage to uneasy calm. After his indictment in 1995, Mr. Mladic evaded arrest for 16 years, despite the presence of thousands of NATO soldiers in the region for much of that time. The Serbian military long shielded him, paid him a salary and continues to pay him a pension. In 1997, for example, he enjoyed an apparently pleasant summer: He spent a week by the turquoise waters of the Montenegro coast, and he was host at his son’s wedding at a well-known Belgrade hotel where United Nations officials were staying. In 2000, thousands of women from Srebrenica won the right to establish a cemetery to the dead in their hometown — by that time inhabited almost exclusively by Serbs. Almost two decades later, the number of white headstones is still growing. The leader of the Serb Republic, the autonomous entity where Srebrenica lies, has officially denied that any genocide occurred. Mr. Mladic was found hiding in a village near the Serbia-Romania border, 16 years after his initial indictment by a United Nations tribunal. His arrest removed one obstacle in Serbia’s continued efforts toward European Union membership but raised questions about who had helped him through the years.",His victims call him the Butcher of Bosnia. His defenders say he was a nationalist trying to defend his people as Yugoslavia collapsed.,"His victims call him the Butcher of Bosnia. His defenders say he was a nationalist trying to defend his people as Yugoslavia collapsed. around them. In this war-torn country, there is no consensus on Radovan Karadzic's legacy, and that has made it difficult for Bosnians to come together in their efforts to bring justice to those who died during the 1992–95 conflict that followed independence from Serbia. On Monday, Mr. Karadzic was convicted by an international tribunal at The Hague for genocide, crimes against humanity and other atrocities committed by Serb forces during the Balkan wars that erupted after Slovenia declared its secession from what had been Communist federal republic Yugoslavia. He could face up to life imprisonment. Mr. Karadzic, 70, showed little emotion when Judge Orie told the courtroom he would be sentenced next month, but he did not deny responsibility for any crimes that were proved beyond reasonable doubt, including massacres in Srebrenica and Zepa and shelling attacks on Sarajevo and Gorazde. The verdict came more than 16 years after a U.N.-imposed arms embargo forced Serbs out of Bosnia. It also marked a milestone in the long quest by Bosnia's survivors and relatives to hold accountable some of those responsible for one of Europe's bloodiest conflicts since World War II. The verdict will have far-reaching consequences. If Bosnia can prove that Mr. Karadzic played a role in planning or directing atrocities committed in 1995 by Serbian troops under General Ratko Mladic, a former army commander now awaiting trial in Belgrade, the Hague court would then sentence both men. That would mean Mr. Karadzic's conviction for genocide could carry an additional penalty. Prosecutors said they would appeal, arguing that the evidence presented did not meet legal standards. They said they will ask the appeals chamber of three judges to overturn Mr. Karadzic's convictions and acquit him. Mr. Karadzic's lawyer asked the judge to delay sentencing until after an expected appeals hearing, saying there were errors in procedure. ""I think we should wait,"" defense attorney Vasilije Jovic said after the verdict was read out, adding: ""We are going to fight."" The verdict could take months to reach because a panel of five appellate judges must first review the case before deciding whether the conviction meets the required standard of proof. A decision could still take several more weeks. A guilty verdict means Mr. Karadzic would become only the second person tried for committing war crimes in the postwar period. Slobodan Milosevic was found guilty by another international tribunal in November 2006 of masterminding ethnic cleansing in Kosovo during NATO air strikes. In addition to being a defendant, Mr. Karadzic also served as president of Republika Srpska (Serbian Republic), which proclaimed itself independent from Sarajevo, and he led Bosnian Croats and Muslims against each other. ""It is a great day for justice. I am very happy. This man should never walk free again,"" Dragan Djuklic, whose father was killed by Serbian soldiers near Banja Luka, a town close to where Mr. Karadzic grew up, said outside the courthouse in Scheveningen. The verdict is unlikely to satisfy all of Bosnia's war dead, however. Many families, especially among Muslim civilians from towns like Mostar and Tuzla, who lost loved ones at the hands of Mr. Karadzic and his associates, say he deserves much harsher punishment than 40 years behind bars. The prosecution argued that the verdict against the 70-year-old former political leader and wartime military chief was necessary because he helped plan and execute mass killings. In a statement issued by his lawyers, he called the trial politically motivated and vowed to continue fighting to clear his name. Mr. Karadzic, known as Drzakovac (the butcher) in his home region, was born into an Orthodox family of modest background in eastern Herzegovina in the early 1940s. After graduating with honors from law school in Zagreb, Croatia, he returned to work in the small village of Kravice, near Trebinje. There he married Vesna Puscek and fathered two children. In 1974 he became mayor of Pale and later deputy prime minister of the self-declared statelet that was established within a few days of Bosnia declaring its secession from communist rule in March 1981. He was arrested for allegedly plotting with Croatian nationalists to assassinate Josip Brodsko, then head of Yugoslav intelligence. The charges, dropped after an investigation by Yugoslav security services, did nothing to diminish Mr. Karadzic's reputation for ruthlessness and cunning in politics, as well as his ability to inspire loyalty and fear. He moved to neighboring Montenegro and later joined other exiled leaders in a secretive group called the National Liberation Army of Kosovo (NLA). The NLA was formed by ethnic Albanians who had been expelled from their homes during the war in Serbia, but it also included some Serbs who were fighting for an independent Kosovo. In 1999 the United States recognized Kosovo’s independence and NATO began bombing Yugoslavia to stop Serbian forces trying to regain control. But Milosevic continued his campaign against Kosovar rebels, even after he lost power in Belgrade in October 2000. His death on March 11 at age 66 came just days before a new government is set to take office. “He will be remembered as one of the most evil men that ever lived,” said former President Bill Clinton. The Nuremberg Tribunal tried him for crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life imprisonment, which was commuted by Slobodan Milošević, then president of Serbia, to house arrest and exile. The International Criminal Court has issued three warrants for his capture on charges of genocide, murder, persecution, deportation and forcible transfer. The court says it still wants to try him. He died without facing justice, but the court will not give up its pursuit of his legacy. “The fact that Milosevic is dead does not mean we can forget about what happened under his rule,” Fatmir Hoxha, a member of Parliament for Kosovo and one of his victims, told reporters on Thursday. “We have a lot of work ahead of us.” As prime minister of Serbia in 1989, Mr. Milosevic oversaw brutal crackdowns against protesters demanding democratic reform and greater autonomy. After NATO intervened in June 1999 to halt those attacks, he led his country into civil war with separatist guerrillas, using scorched-earth tactics that left thousands of civilians homeless and killed tens of thousands more, according to Human Rights Watch and others. In December 2008, Mr. Milosevic was convicted at the Hague tribunal for atrocities committed during Bosnia’s bloody breakup, including ordering troops to shell Sarajevo’s civilian population during the siege by Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Orthodox Christians in July and August 1995. A few months later, a U.N.-imposed arms embargo forced the withdrawal of Serbian soldiers from Kosovo and ended his reign there. But he remained defiant, refusing to cooperate with investigators or acknowledge any wrongdoing, even when it became clear that he would eventually face trial. The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Dec. 22, 2010, for Mr. Milosevic to stand trial on four counts: committing aggression; violating international humanitarian law by attacking noncombatants; persecuting members of national minorities and causing mass displacement of people in violation of human rights; and obstructing investigations of alleged violations by his armed forces in Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia. In January, however, the Yugoslav War Crimes Chamber in Banja Luka, a city controlled by Republika Srpska, declared itself unable to conduct proceedings because Serbia refused to extradite him for prosecution, citing concerns over Mr. Milosevic’s health. A month later, the Hague court ruled that Serbia could no longer shield Mr. Milosevic from justice because it had failed to comply with previous orders to surrender him. In February 2011, the Serbian authorities arrested and charged him with contempt of the court. The next year, Mr. Milosevic was found guilty and ordered to pay reparations, which amounted to less than $1 million. His family paid a fraction of that amount. “I am very happy, I feel like I’m free now,” Mr. Hoxha said in a telephone interview, adding, “But the real freedom comes only with the truth being revealed about all these things that Milosevic did.” “It’s important for me to know why my father, mother and brother are buried in Serbia and why they died in such horrible conditions, because of Milosevic,” he added. “And it’s important to me that he be held accountable for everything he did.” Mr. Milosevic died at University Hospital Center Zagreb, where he was taken by helicopter for treatment for heart problems. Doctors had warned of complications if he underwent surgery to replace his pacemaker, so his lawyers asked for permission to fly to Vienna. But a judge denied them the request, saying he was too ill to travel and should remain hospitalized, his lawyer Vesna Pesic said. He died there. In Serbia, where Mr. Milosevic remains revered as a hero and symbol of resistance against Western imperialism, many expressed anger over his demise, saying it showed how little punishment his actions merited."
