"VAULX-EN-VELIN, France — France may have just hosted its biggest outpouring of solidarity since the end of World War II in response to the terrorist attacks last week in and around Paris that left 17 dead at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. But in the disaffected suburbs, or banlieues, that ring France’s largest cities, those appeals for unity hardly penetrated the sense of isolation, even siege, that has left cities like this one living a parallel existence from the rest of the country. “I am French, and I feel French,” said Nabil Souidi, 23. “But here you are forbidden to say, ‘I am Charlie,’ ” referring to the rallying cry of solidarity since the attack on the magazine. Mr. Souidi recently graduated from a trade school and hoped to find a job as a mechanic. Months later, he is still out of work, searching for a Plan B. “I’ll go to Syria,” he said, with a sarcastic laugh in an interview over a plate of French fries and mayonnaise. For him and many other French Muslims, the nation’s preoccupation with last week’s attacks at the hands of Islamic extremists presents a mere distraction from a fundamental social crisis that has plagued France’s immigrant neighborhoods for decades. In numerous interviews, community leaders and Muslims and North Africans who largely populate the banlieues expressed concern that last week’s attacks in Paris would intensify an already explosive social and economic situation in the places where they live. On Tuesday, a French association that represents 120 mayors across France issued a statement warning that the banlieues were “on edge” amid the fallout from the attacks, and said there was an urgent need to address economic, social and educational shortfalls. Vaulx-en-Velin, a dreary Muslim-majority suburb of Lyon, is France’s third-poorest city and representative of the problems. Many youths simply call it “a ghetto.” It might also be called the Other France. Here, and in numerous other poor suburbs that ring French cities, joblessness runs around 20 percent, about double the national average. For young people, it can be as high as 40 percent. About half of residents do not have a high school diploma. Police harassment and profiling are taken for granted as the rule. In a time of budget cuts and austerity, conditions have only deteriorated despite years of pledges by successive governments, including President François Hollande’s, to improve schools and create opportunity. The men who carried out the attacks — Saïd Kouachi and his brother Chérif, and Amedy Coulibaly, who seized the kosher market — grew up in the French banlieues and had failed to hold down a series of menial jobs in their youth. All were attracted to Islamic extremism by their teenage years, and many residents in the banlieues consider them bad seeds who were propelled toward the fringe. Yet the fallout from their attacks, and the response shown by the rest of France, has been Topic A along the gritty streets of many impoverished suburbs from Paris down through the south of France. Many worried that as Muslims, they would be lumped together with the killers. Others spoke of fears of retaliation against mosques and other Muslim symbols, as well as the specter of reprisals or even a crackdown by the police after officers were murdered in the terrorist attacks. “People feel like there is no solution — that they are just totally divided from the rest of society,” said Gounedi Traore, 37, a social worker at the Centre Social Intercommunal de la Dhuys, a community center in Clichy-sous-Bois, a suburb outside of Paris that is one of France’s most economically deprived. “After what happened with Charlie Hebdo, I feel that this is going to set off a war.” Nearly everyone agreed that the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including a heightened security response by France and its allies, was a distraction from a larger problem: a sense of increasing social and economic marginalization that many cited as a root cause of young people drifting toward extremism. “The attacks had a global impact but not local impact,” said Faouzi Hamdi, rector of the Okba Ibn Nafee Mosque in Vaulx-en-Velin. Community leaders say France’s drawn-out economic crisis has made already scarce job opportunities even worse. “We are not treating the problem at its roots,” said Leila Legmara, a deputy mayor for education in the Paris suburb of Colombes. “Of course we need more security and resources to fight terrorism. But we also need to address what it is within our society that is capable of producing monsters.” The sense of marginalization did not disappear with the massive solidarity march across Paris on Sunday, which drew more than one million people and 40 presidents and prime ministers to Mr. Hollande’s side. For some banlieue residents, it seemed an almost surreal display that had nothing to do with them. In Vaulx-en-Velin, the only Charlie reference to be seen was a sign for the Charlie Chaplin cultural center across the street from City Hall, which is topped with a drawing of a flag of its sister city, the West Bank town of Beit Sahour. Residents there ridiculed the “I am Charlie” marches. Some said the terrorist attacks had been staged. While many strongly condemned the attackers for the murders, others insisted the cartoonists had gotten what they deserved. Local leaders say this city of 44,000 is a microcosm of France’s failed integration policy, and the underlying social problems that have encouraged young people toward radicalization. Places like Vaulx-en-Velin have remained “priority zones” for the government since 1964, some noted. As in Clichy-sous-Bois, youth here said they felt as if they were living in a separate country, detached from the social and economic benefits of the state and abandoned by a system that preaches unity and solidarity with France’s republican secular values. “I totally feel cut off from France,” said Karim Yahiaoui, 15, who added that he had not left this suburb more than twice in the past year. Over the past few decades, the Muslim community in Vaulx-en-Velin has become increasingly insular. “Many people only believe their own values now, not those of the republic,” said Anne Dufaud, director of the Mission, a nonprofit organization. She has worked in the community for 20 years. When Mr. Hollande led a moment of silence across France last Thursday for the victims of the attacks, two students and a teacher at a local high school, who declined to be identified, said many students refused to stand. Patrick Kahn, a manager at the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism in Lyon, who operates a weekly tolerance program in the schools of Vaulx-en-Velin, said simply, “The integration policy failed.” “The suburbs were left behind in government planning, so they became segregated communities,” he explained. Fear of the authorities was already omnipresent, reflected in crude antipolice graffiti on many of the concrete housing complexes, which residents call “les cages de poulet,” or chicken coops. The attacks only deepened concerns about racial profiling — already a common occurrence. One woman wearing an abaya said she had left the house only twice since the Charlie Hebdo attacks because she was afraid of the authorities. Inside schools, students said there were already deep social divisions between Muslims and non-Muslims. One community leader said it was impossible to open a discussion about the Charlie Hebdo attacks without first explaining what satire, caricatures and freedom of expression were. Several teachers said their attempts to discuss the events had led to tense exchanges. “Schools reflect the society,” said Stéphane Gomez, general councilor and deputy mayor of Vaulx-en-Velin. Mr. Gomez is also a high school teacher in the region. “We have to talk about what has gone wrong and reopen the debates that we’ve been afraid to talk about for so long,” he said. In Clichy-sous-Bois, residents said such a debate would have to include a hard look at the economic and social segregation that has defined France’s banlieues decade after decade. “We need to give people ways to succeed,” said Mohamed Mokkadem, 37, who runs a trucking company, SKL Transports. Mr. Mokkadem had tried, to no avail, to buy a copy of the latest Charlie Hebdo that hit newsstands on Wednesday. He said he was curious to see close-up the new depiction of the Prophet Muhammad on the cover. Conditions were already bleak in his neighborhood even before the killings, he said, and now, more than ever, he wanted to send a pointed message to the government and the country. “What we are asking for is to be respected according to our worth,” he said. “The message, quite simply, is to be regarded as truly French.”","VAULX-EN-VELIN, France — France may have just hosted its biggest outpouring of solidarity since the end of World War II in response to the terrorist attacks last week in and around Paris that left 17 dead at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket.

Palestinian officials demanded international action against Israel and vowed no letup in the demonstrations. “We are asking the world and especially the Arab World to intervene immediately to end the massacre of our people,” Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, an interim government that has held sway in Europe since the end of World War II. “I think he’s going to delegate to people like me, potentially, and others,” Mr. Brown said of Zhongnanhai, “is in part because it is the guarantor of the international order and the guardian of important alliances.

Those strategies backfired and ultimately ended up benefiting the oil industry. Overcoming three years of slumping prices proved the resiliency of the shale boom. Energy companies and their financial backers were able to weather market turmoil — and the maneuvers of the global oil cartel — by adjusting exploration and extraction techniques. After a painful shakeout in the industry that included scores of bankruptcies and a significant loss of jobs, a steadier shale-drilling industry is arising, anchored by better-financed companies.

Doing so is already illegal, but the bill would make it much easier for states to opt out of several requirements, including what some say is the crux of the current health law: the ban on insurance companies charging higher premiums to people, like Ms. Slayton, with pre-existing medical conditions. “We cannot call everybody who takes to the streets dirt and dust, cow, sheep or trash,” he said in a Facebook post.

"If Donald J. Trump wins the White House and proceeds to persuade Congress to pass his tax agenda, middle-class Americans will get a small tax cut, wealthy Americans and businesses will get a huge tax cut, and the budget deficit will widen substantially unless there is the type of economic boom he promises amid lower taxes and lighter regulation. If Hillary Clinton wins the White House and persuades Congress to pass her agenda, wealthy Americans will pay higher taxes, businesses will face tax rules that make it less advantageous to relocate overseas, and the money those changes produce will go to fund the rest of her policy agenda, from child care to roads, bridges and other infrastructure. That, in a nutshell, is the tax policy choice Americans face when they vote in November, based on plans the two candidates have released and discussed in major speeches this week. Of course, campaign proposals never end up in law in exactly the form candidates talk about them on the stump. But tax policy puts some hard numbers on the sometimes vague rhetoric of the campaign trail. It shows where exactly a candidate’s priorities and vision are, in dollars-and-cents terms. Elections have consequences, and this is what those consequences might look like if a President Clinton or a President Trump got Congress to reshape the tax code their way. Current: The federal tax rate on income over $467,000 for a married couple is now 39.6 percent. Many high-income families benefit from large deductions for things like home mortgage interest and state income tax. Many of these families also have a substantial portion of their income from long-term capital gains, usually taxed at 23.8 percent. What Mr. Trump would do: He would cut the top marginal income tax rate to 33 percent. An analysis by the Tax Foundation of the House Republicans’ tax plan, on which Mr. Trump’s is based, found it would increase after-tax income for the richest 1 percent by 5.3 percent. Mr. Trump also advocates lowering the tax rate on all business income to 15 percent — and has advocated that the rate apply to all sorts of businesses, including partnerships and sole proprietorships. That opens up room for people to find ways to turn what is now taxed as individual income into “pass-through” business income at that low 15 percent rate, especially those in position to hire tax lawyers to help them figure out the details. For example, an executive who is paid $1 million in salary could instead form a limited liability corporation to “sell” $1 million of management services to his or her old company, cutting the tax rate to 15 percent. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She envisions a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over $5 million, meaning that the very highest earners would effectively have a nearly 44 percent top marginal rate. She also envisions implementing a rule so that those with income over $1 million pay at least 30 percent, aimed at preventing high earners from paying low overall rates thanks to the lower capital gains tax. She would also limit the value of tax deductions, and require longer holding periods to get the low long-term capital gains tax rate, among other steps that would make the tax code less favorable to the affluent. Current: For a married couple making between $18,551 and $75,300, the official marginal tax rate is 15 percent. But in practice, about 45 percent of American taxpayers pay no individual income tax (they do pay federal payroll taxes), because of various tax credits that particularly favor families with children. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to lower taxes across the board in line with a proposal earlier in the year by House Republicans, which reduced the 15 percent income tax bracket to 12 percent. The Tax Foundation estimated that plan would raise after-tax income for families in the 20th-to-40th percentiles by 0.5 percent, and for middle-income taxpayers by 0.2 percent. Mr. Trump also wants to make child care tax-deductible. If the policy were implemented as a typical deduction, it would provide no advantage for the 45 percent of people paying no tax and provide the biggest advantages to people in high-income tax brackets. His campaign has indicated that the Trump administration would find ways to make its advantages shared more broadly, though staffers had no details. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Americans in the bottom 95 percent of income would see little or no change to their taxes under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. She wants a child care tax credit as part of a broader effort to make child care more affordable, and while she has not enumerated all the details of what she has in mind, a refundable credit would avoid the problems created by offering a tax deduction and would be valuable for lower- and middle-income families even if they don’t pay federal income tax. Current: When a person dies, the first $5.45 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, $10.9 million for a married couple. Assets above those levels are generally taxed at 40 percent before being passed on to heirs. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to eliminate the estate tax, or the “death tax” as he and other Republicans refer to it, allowing even the wealthiest people to pass along their assets to heirs without being taxed. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She would lower the levels of exemptions to $3.5 million for individuals and $7 million for a couple. More families would have to pay, and very wealthy families would pay taxes on a higher portion of their assets. She would also increase the tax rate on affected estates to 45 percent. Current: It’s complicated. The official corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, higher than for most advanced countries. But the United States also offers a complex range of deductions that mean the effective rate — what is actually collected by the government — is much lower. If that combination of a high rate but low tax collections doesn’t sound very good, congratulations: Tax writers in both political parties agree with you. What Mr. Trump would do: He would sharply cut the top tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent. And he would apply that rate to partnerships and other types of businesses that currently pass their profits on to individuals who then are taxed at individual income rates as high as 39.6 percent. He would simultaneously eliminate a wide range of business deductions. With the new, lower rate, businesses that earn money overseas and currently keep it outside the United States would have less incentive to do so. So they might repatriate money, pay the lower tax and invest it at home. The proposal would sharply reduce the tax burden on companies, reducing government revenue by $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation’s estimate. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She seeks a series of tweaks to the corporate tax code to try to dissuade companies from moving operations abroad to save on taxes. One provision would change a key rule to make it harder to execute “tax inversions,” in which a United States firm merges with a foreign competitor and moves its corporate headquarters overseas in order to get access to lower taxes in the merger partner’s country. Another would limit the deductibility of interest when it is used as a tool to avoid American taxes. A third provision is an “exit tax” on companies that relocate outside the United States without first repatriating earnings kept abroad. Mrs. Clinton has also pitched tax credits for companies that hire workers from apprenticeships or share profits with their workers. In her speech Thursday, she said she would reduce red tape facing small businesses as they try to pay their taxes. Current: The United States is on track to have a budget deficit of $534 billion in the current fiscal year and a total of $9.3 trillion over the coming decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would gradually push the total debt relative to the economy to 86 percent from about 75 percent. What Mr. Trump would do: He just overhauled his tax plan on Monday, and there aren’t detailed estimates available yet. But his earlier plan was estimated to reduce federal revenue by $9.5 trillion over the next decade. If not offset by either huge spending cuts or a major burst in economic growth, that would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, even before accounting for potentially higher interest rates as a result. His new proposal would probably reduce tax revenues by less than his original did, though exactly how much has not been fully modeled. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Her tax proposals are estimated to increase federal revenue by $1.1 trillion over the decade. She has said she would use that increased revenue to cover the cost of other policy proposals, with the intention of making her overall agenda have a neutral effect on the budget deficit. An earlier version of this article misstated an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of the budget deficit over the coming decade. It’s $9.3 trillion, not $3.5 trillion. That would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, not 3.7 times larger. An earlier version of this article misstated the exemption threshold for the estate tax for a married couple. The first $10.9 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, not the first $12.9 million.","If Donald J.

"BOSTON — Tens of thousands of demonstrators, emboldened and unnerved by the eruption of fatal violence in Virginia last weekend, surged into the nation’s streets and parks on Saturday to denounce racism, white supremacy and Nazism. Demonstrations were boisterous but broadly peaceful, even as tension and worry coursed through protests from Boston Common, the nation’s oldest public park, to Hot Springs, Ark., and to the bridges that cross the Willamette River in Portland, Ore. Other rallies played out in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Memphis and New Orleans, among other cities. The demonstrations — which drew 40,000 people in Boston alone, according to police estimates — came one week after a 32-year-old woman died amid clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., and they unfolded as the nation was again confronting questions about race, violence and the standing of Confederate symbols. President Trump, who has faced unyielding — and bipartisan — criticism after saying that there was “blame on both sides” in Charlottesville, tweeted Saturday that he wanted “to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!” He also wrote: “Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before!” It was an abrupt shift in tone. The president posted earlier Saturday that it appeared there were “many anti-police agitators in Boston.” Law enforcement officials were on alert throughout the day, wary of being seen as irresolute and ineffective after the protests in Virginia turned into running street battles and turned fatal when someone drove a car through a crowd. Officers in riot gear sometimes faced off with demonstrators to maintain order. There were scattered scuffles and arrests; in Boston, site of the largest of the weekend’s protests, the police said there had been 33 arrests, mostly involving charges of disorderly conduct. Boston, where officials had pledged to enforce a policy of zero tolerance for violence, had been facing dueling demonstrations, but a rally to promote “free speech” was brief and unamplified beyond the small bandstand where it was held. The event, whose participants appeared to number only in the dozens, was undercut by police planning and starved by an enormous buffer zone between the handful of protesters and the overwhelming numbers of their opponents. Organizers of the speech rally had said they were appealing to “libertarians, conservatives, traditionalists, classical liberals, Trump supporters or anyone else who enjoys their right to free speech.” “All of us here, in many ways, are true patriots because, in spite of that noise out there, we’re here to stand up for something very fundamental, which is called free speech,” Shiva Ayyadurai, an entrepreneur who is running a long-shot Republican Senate campaign, told the rallygoers, according to a video posted on YouTube. But thousands of others, fearing that the free speech event would be a platform for neo-Nazis and white nationalists, joined a robust counterprotest. “This city has a history of fighting back against oppression, whether it’s dumping tea in the harbor or a bunch of dudes standing around with bandannas screaming at neo-Nazis,” said a 21-year-old protester who identified himself only as “Frosty” and wore an American flag to obscure much of his face. Some counterprotesters shouted down their opponents — “No Nazis! No K.K.K.! No fascist U.S.A.!” — as state troopers used their bikes to keep rival demonstrators apart. “We didn’t want for what happened in Virginia to happen here,” William B. Evans, Boston’s police commissioner, said at a news conference after Saturday’s main protests. “We didn’t want them at each other’s throats.” The free speech rally, which had been scheduled to run from noon until 2 p.m., concluded by about 12:50 p.m. Mr. Evans, who said the event ended early by mutual agreement between the authorities and the event’s organizers, said the police had helped the demonstrators get into police wagons as part of a prearranged “exit strategy.” It was then, he said, that “we had some kids block the street, it got a little confrontational, but they were given every opportunity to move.” “We had to do a little pushing and shoving there,” said Mr. Evans, whose department reported that some people pelted officers with rocks and that some demonstrators threw bottles of urine at officers. Rondre Brooks, 36, who said he had traveled from Detroit for the counterdemonstration, said he was pleased to see the early end of the free speech rally amid the large number of counterprotesters. “It’s a very good look for America as a whole,” he said. But another man, who said he supported the speech rally and gave his name, after some hesitation, as Matt Staley, interjected to ask if those demonstrating in support of free speech were not Americans, too. “I think it’s awful that people can’t speak out to express opinions,” Mr. Staley said. The counterprotesters descended on the Common hours before the rally and found fliers showing white supremacist and neo-Nazi symbols. The leaflets, which other counterprotesters appeared to have prepared, urged people to “learn to identify these symbols and let anyone displaying them know that they are not welcome in our city!” “Charlottesville is what forced me out here,” said Rose Fowler, 68, a retired teacher who is black and was among the people who had gathered to march from Roxbury toward the Common, about two miles away. “Somebody killed for fighting for me. What is wrong with me if I can’t fight for myself and others?” Although the protests in Boston were expected to be the weekend’s largest, people gathered on Friday evening in Portland for an “Eclipse Hate” rally. The Oregon protest swelled to more than 1,000 people, and demonstrators swarmed two of Portland’s bridges, halting traffic in both directions and chanting: “Whose bridge? Our bridge!” In Arkansas, a small demonstration supporting Confederate symbols drew about 50 people in Hot Springs. Opponents walked by occasionally, denouncing Mr. Trump and racial hatred. At least three people were arrested. And along a side street in Charlottesville, the mood was somber about 1:30 p.m., as people marked the time a week earlier when a man drove his car into a crowd, killing Heather D. Heyer. Ms. Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, stood before a memorial of flowers and candles, weeping as she leaned into her husband, Kim Bro. Hundreds of people gathered around as someone wrote with purple chalk — Ms. Heyer’s favorite color — on the pavement, “I miss you baby girl, love mom.” Ms. Bro eventually encouraged people to come closer to her. Some people laid hands on her, and they sang “This Little Light of Mine.” Ms. Bro said she hoped that some good could come out of her daughter’s death. And for those who might take joy in seeing her grieve, she said, “Karma’s a you know what.” Law enforcement officials made extensive plans for the demonstrations in the wake of the Virginia bloodshed. In Dallas, where a gunman killed five police officers who were protecting a protest in July 2016, the authorities formed a barricade around Saturday’s demonstration site with buses and dump trucks to “lock down” the area and keep any cars from drawing too close. As sunset approached at a Confederate monument in the city, people engaged in shouting matches, but no violence, while state troopers stood guard and helicopters flew overhead. As the rally outside City Hall was winding down, tensions heightened at the Confederate monument at a park nearby. Shouting matches erupted between protesters wearing bandannas over their faces and a group of counterprotesters wearing Confederate belt buckles and flags. Water bottles were thrown at police officers on horseback, and water and what appeared to be urine were sprayed on the Confederate supporters. One monument supporter, wearing a red “Make America Great Again” cap, declined to give his real name but identified himself as Wiggz, a 32-year-old Dallas resident. “They can call it an anti-white-supremacist rally all they want,” he said. “I don’t believe it is. I think it’s an anti-Trump rally. And that’s why I’m here. I’m a Trump supporter, and I’m not a white supremacist at all.” Before the Dallas protests began, several men and women armed with high-powered rifles and dressed in military fatigues assembled near a rally site. A representative of the group, called the Texas Elite III%, said they planned to provide security at the rally and were not affiliated with either side. “With Charlottesville and how things went down there, and what we’ve heard so far intel-wise, we are expecting possible problems,” said the representative, who declined to give her real name and identified herself as Momma Doc. The Boston authorities seemed to face nothing of that sort on Saturday, but they cleared the Common of vendors and their carts and shut down the Swan Boats, a nearby tourist attraction. Tensions here had been rising all week. On Monday night, a teenager threw a rock at the New England Holocaust Memorial, shattering the glass; passers-by quickly tackled the youth before the police arrived. But elsewhere in the country, officials were moving to defuse anger that surrounded the revived debate about Confederate monuments. Duke University announced early Saturday that it had removed a recently vandalized statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee from the entrance to its campus chapel in Durham, N.C. “I took this course of action to protect Duke Chapel, to ensure the vital safety of students and community members who worship there, and above all to express the deep and abiding values of our university,” Vincent E. Price, the university’s president, said in an email to students, employees and alumni. Dr. Price said the statue would be “preserved so that students can study Duke’s complex past and take part in a more inclusive future.”","BOSTON — Tens of thousands of demonstrators, emboldened and unnerved by the eruption of fatal violence in Virginia last weekend, surged into the nation’s streets and parks on Saturday to denounce racism, white supremacy and Nazism.

We were like chickens spinning on a rotisserie."
"Zaida Catalán was on to something, and it was making her jumpy. “Exciting development,” she scribbled in her diary in late January. “I can maybe nail this bastard. Damn!” Weeks later, Ms. Catalán, a United Nations investigator with little training and no safety equipment or even health insurance, headed into a remote area teeming with militia fighters to find the culprits behind a massacre in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A grainy cellphone video shows what happened next: A cluster of men with rifles and red bandannas lead Ms. Catalán, a 36-year-old Swedish-Chilean, into a grove with her American colleague, Michael J. Sharp, 34. The two investigators are barefoot. Mr. Sharp starts arguing. He and Ms. Catalán are forced onto the ground. Suddenly, shots are fired, hitting Mr. Sharp first. Ms. Catalán screams and tries to run for cover. She is shot twice. Their bodies were discovered weeks later in a shallow grave, laid out carefully, side by side, in opposite directions. Ms. Catalán had been decapitated. Her head had been taken. Their deaths raise tough questions about the United Nations and its work in the most dangerous places in the world. Almost two months passed before the United Nations even assembled a panel to look into what went wrong. The United Nations Security Council could go further and order a more formal investigation, but more than two months after the murders, it has taken no steps in that direction. Instead, it has left the investigation to Congo, a nation where violence, corruption and impunity are so widespread that the United Nations has had to spend billions of dollars over the years in a failed effort to bring peace and stability. Indeed, a big focus of Ms. Catalán and her colleagues was whether the Congolese government played a role in the massacre and broader chaos she was investigating. “The U.N. needs to take ownership,” said Akshaya Kumar, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch. She added that the Congolese authorities, who are implicated in the region’s conflict, were in no position to carry out a credible investigation. The killings have also stirred a sharp debate over the United Nations’ responsibility to prepare and protect the people it hires to investigate wrongdoing around the world. Ms. Catalán and Mr. Sharp belonged to a panel of six experts authorized by the Security Council to investigate rapes, massacres and the exploitation of Congo’s vast natural resources. They traveled without United Nations escorts, often going into areas that are no-go zones for United Nations employees. In this case, the two hired three motorcycle taxis and a Congolese interpreter to ferry them into the countryside. Their Congolese companions are still missing. There is no evidence that they have been killed. As independent contractors, the investigators had no health insurance and received little training on how to operate in hostile environments. They were bound by the United Nations’ security rules; don’t travel on motorcycle taxis was one. But former investigators say United Nations officials know full well the risks that experts routinely take to do their jobs. At least two said they had asked for electronic devices to track their locations and send distress signals, in case of emergencies exactly like this. The United Nations, through a spokesman, said it was not “a feasible requirement” to provide them. “They were more looking at protecting themselves than protecting us,” said Daniel Fahey, who served on the Congo panel in 2013 and 2014. “Everyone loved our analyses. But no one really asked us: ‘How do you guys do this? What do you need?’” Frans Barnard, a former British Army officer who served on the Congo panel in 2014, said he had been concerned enough to buy his own location tracker. “In my world, duty of care means if we ask you to do something, we give you the training and the equipment to do that,” Mr. Barnard said. Asked whether the United Nations had done enough to prepare and protect the experts, José Luis Díaz, a spokesman, said the organization was asking itself the same question. “This is why the U.N. is looking at the whole sequence of events in the disappearance and murder of our colleagues,” he said in an email. “We want to assess whether things worked as they should, and if what we have in place is adequate or robust enough.” Congo has a long history of conflict and suffering. Foreign powers, successive leaders and an alphabet soup of rebel groups have all pillaged its rich natural resources. The country is the focus of the most expensive peacekeeping operation in the world. But the mission, called Monusco, has often been criticized for turning a blind eye to human rights abuses committed by government forces and rebels alike. Ms. Catalán, a former Green Party activist in Sweden who had been working as a United Nations expert for less than a year, quickly got sucked into an extraordinarily dangerous world that she was woefully unprepared for, where the line between murderous rebels and corrupt politicians often blurs. She worked assiduously to untangle a murky web of local politicians, rebel leaders and government ministers, trying to pin down perpetrators so that the Security Council could impose sanctions on them. Her tools often boiled down to a pen that doubled as a recorder, and a determined line of inquiry that ended up putting her life in danger. It is still unclear who ordered the murders of the experts. The Congolese government said it had released the cellphone video to show that militia fighters, not its soldiers, were responsible. In April, the government announced the arrests of two men. One escaped. Then, on Saturday, the Congolese said they knew who had ordered the killings and where Ms. Catalán’s head was, but gave no further details. But according to documents kept on Ms. Catalán’s computer and to others familiar with the case, she had been scrutinizing a government minister, Clément Kanku, for his possible role in inciting violence in the Congolese region of Kasai last year. Mr. Kanku, the minister of development until he was fired this month, had close links to the militia fighters in the area; he had been brought into President Joseph Kabila’s coalition government last year to bring the rebels to heel. Ms. Catalán kept 130 files in a folder on her computer under Mr. Kanku’s name. Among them was a recorded phone conversation in which he seems to discuss setting fire to a town in the region, Tshimbulu, with a subordinate. They talk about a successful jailbreak, targeted assassinations of a colonel and other officials, and general mayhem. “We burnt Tshimbulu,” the subordinate is heard saying. “It’s good that we burn everything; that is good news,” Mr. Kanku replies. “The colonel is in his house, and we’re burning down the house so he burns to death,” the subordinate says. Mr. Kanku asks: “Did you kill the colonel’s bodyguards?” “Yes, we beat his bodyguards on the head with our batons,” the subordinate responds. Though it was unclear how she had obtained it, Ms. Catalán had the recording in her possession in January, according to people familiar with her work, the same month she wrote in her diary about the big breakthrough. She had also texted Mr. Sharp, her colleague in Congo: “I have big stuff going on.” People familiar with the case said Mr. Kanku had known she had the audio file. In fact, she had told Mr. Kanku that she had it, they said, and was scheduled to discuss the matter with him after her trip into the bush. When contacted by The New York Times, Mr. Kanku initially denied, then confirmed, that he had been in contact with the experts. “I talked with the man; the woman, I didn’t talk to her.” When pressed, he replied: “I think I also spoke with the woman, but I’m not sure because many people call me.” “Listen, where are you? Can I see you?” he continued, sounding nervous. “I can’t talk right now. I’ll call you after.” Mr. Kanku abruptly hung up without addressing the contents of the tape. He did not call back or respond to multiple calls after that. It was Ms. Catalán’s sister, Elizabeth, who first raised the alarm that the United Nations investigators were in trouble. Late in the afternoon on March 12, she received an unnerving call from Ms. Catalán’s cellphone. “I couldn’t hear her voice,” she said in their family’s home in Sweden. “I just heard lots of men talking in the background, not just a few but many, a group of men talking.” Sensing something wrong, the family frantically reached out to Ms. Catalán’s colleagues in the United Nations. The United Nations said peacekeepers “sprang into action from the very start,” with troops and helicopters deployed the next morning, according to Mr. Díaz, the spokesman. The few peacekeepers stationed nearby began searching by road and air. But it took four days to deploy more United Nations forces from other parts of the country and begin a robust search, according to the commander of Monusco’s Uruguayan forces, Col. Luis Mangini. It took a full two weeks to find the bodies. The autopsy concluded little. Death by multiple injuries, it said. Ms. Catalán’s second autopsy report, conducted by a private Ugandan pathology service, said the body, initially examined by the Congolese authorities, “had neither blood staining, mud nor soiling of any sort, suggesting that the body had been washed clean.” Families and friends of Ms. Catalán said they were unaware of just how dangerous her job was, even compared with her earlier assignments. Ms. Catalán previously worked for the European Union, educating local police officers in Afghanistan, Congo and the Palestinian territories on gender-based violence. She once confided to a friend about the ad hoc nature of her United Nations assignment. It was, she said, like living on the edge. In December, during a visit home for Christmas, Ms. Catalán recounted a frightening episode in which she had interviewed a rebel leader accused of committing atrocities. “I barely made it out of that room alive,” Elizabeth, her sister, recalled her saying. The risks began to take a toll on her. A week before her death, she had a disturbing premonition: “My body will be carried out of the jungle,” she confided to a friend. Now, relatives, colleagues and friends are frustrated at the handling of the killings. The Swedish authorities say they are looking into the deaths, but family members are calling on the United Nations to conduct a credible, independent investigation as well. “What we hope for now is an independent international criminal investigation,” said Mr. Sharp’s father, John. “We can’t depend on the Congolese government to do it.”","Zaida Catalán was on to something, and it was making her jumpy. “Exciting development,” she scribbled in her diary in late January.","Zaida Catalán was on to something, and it was making her jumpy. “Exciting development,” she scribbled in her diary in late January.

The American economy had swapped the frivolity of a stock market party for the grim trappings of a bedside vigil. The result was gloom and anxiety in every reach of the financial sphere. “The United States is capable of such an attack against North Korea, while about three-quarters supported using tougher economic sanctions on Pyongyang as a way of pressuring the country to surrender its nuclear arsenal.

Yet even for those who have married Americans. As the Trump administration imposes tariffs on allies and rivals alike, provoking broad retaliation, global commerce is suffering disruption, flashing signs of strains that could hamper economic growth.

"In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass. Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate. On Monday, the Department of Justice sued to block AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, a deal that would unite one of the country’s biggest internet providers with the company that owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film studio. It was a signal from antitrust enforcers that an era of breakneck consolidation might be coming to an end, and that mergers would be evaluated by a new set of standards. Then on Tuesday morning, the Federal Communications Commission announced plans to dismantle net neutrality rules. The move would let companies charge higher fees and block access to some websites, and was effectively a green light for big internet service providers — including AT&T — to freely wield their influence against rivals. In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies. But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future. “We have one government, but two separate agencies with opposing views,” said Spencer Kurn, an analyst at New Street Research. “You’ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there’s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else’s.” At the intersection of both debates is AT&T. A global powerhouse offering access to the internet through mobile phones and landlines, and satellite television service through DirecTV, AT&T has a long history of battling regulators. In 1982, it agreed to break itself up and end a nearly century-old monopoly. In 2011, regulators scuttled its proposed deal to acquire T-Mobile. Randall L. Stephenson, the AT&T chief executive, has vowed to fight the Justice Department in court to save the Time Warner deal. AT&T stands to gain from the rollback of net neutrality rules. It could charge companies and consumers more for high-speed internet access, and use its market influence to hinder content providers it competes against. “It’s an ‘open the champagne bottles’ moment for AT&T,” said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University who coined the term net neutrality — the concept of providing equal access to the internet. “They can just tell people to pony up.” But AT&T’s long-term aspirations could be dealt a severe blow if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking its takeover of Time Warner. On Tuesday, President Trump signaled his approval of the lawsuit. “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country,” he said in response to a question from reporters. If the merger was approved, he suggested, “I think your pricing is going to go up.” For all the good a rollback of net neutrality rules would do AT&T, the company is looking to diversify. Its core businesses of delivering phone, internet and satellite television services are maturing. A big move into the content business would expand the company’s sources of revenue, and give it new opportunities for cost savings. One of AT&T’s biggest competitors, Comcast, has already married content and distribution with the acquisition of NBCUniversal. If the government succeeds in preventing the Time Warner deal, it will raise sharp questions about the future of AT&T, and its competitors. “This could be a watershed event for future business combinations in media,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. “Does this mean Comcast will be broken up?” There is no evidence that the decisions by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. were coordinated. “I do not think it is a well-thought-out, cohesive policy that is coming from the executive office,” said Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Instead, the diverging decisions reflect an effort by different agencies trying to come to grips with a radically transformed media and telecommunications landscape, one where Silicon Valley companies are suddenly powerhouses in content creation, and traditional media companies exert vast influence over how information flows across the internet. “We’re definitely getting mixed messages from the administration,” said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University. The Justice Department’s decision to intervene in the AT&T deal was the more surprising of the two developments this week. Many antitrust experts believe that the government’s case against the deal is weak, because it is a so-called vertical merger, bringing together two businesses that do not compete directly with each other. But the lawsuit is a sign that the Justice Department is beginning to think about antitrust enforcement in fundamentally new ways. The decision by the F.C.C. to roll back net neutrality rules was less surprising, but has equally far-reaching implications. With less regulation, big internet providers will be able to charge more for their services, extract new fees from websites and block content. “The F.C.C. is saying that they’re going to give up any legal authority over regulating high-speed internet,” said Susan Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School. “They’re handing the power to choose winners and losers online to about five companies.” Despite the seeming irreconcilability of the moves by the Justice Department and the F.C.C., some see a common narrative in the two decisions. “They’re both defense strategies against Silicon Valley,” Mr. Wu said. By rolling back net neutrality, the government is giving old-school media companies like AT&T and Comcast more leverage over companies like Netflix, Google and Facebook that are increasingly becoming their competitors. And by challenging the AT&T merger with Time Warner, the Justice Department could be laying the groundwork for a new approach to antitrust enforcement that could be used to go after big technology firms. Barry Diller, the media mogul and chairman of IAC, which owns a host of websites including Match.com and Vimeo, cited the power of tech companies in expressing exasperation at the Justice Department suit. “If you think AT&T has too much market power because of distribution, tell me what happens if you are Facebook and Google, which have unbelievable concentration in distribution,” Mr. Diller said. “How would you ever be able to get a content addition to Google?” And there is another school of thought suggesting that more vigorous antitrust enforcement might have obviated the need for net neutrality rules in the first place. If regulators had been stricter about ensuring robust competition among internet service providers over the years, the theory goes, big firms like AT&T would not be able to operate in ways that harm competition. “Net neutrality was a distant-second-best remedy,” Mr. Sagers said. “If we could have competition in internet service provision, that would have been way better than relying on the F.C.C.” Even if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking AT&T’s deal for Time Warner, the opportunity to use antitrust enforcement as a means to give consumers more choice among internet providers has likely passed. And now, by unwinding net neutrality rules, Mr. Sagers said, the Trump administration will make it easier for big companies like AT&T to maintain the already enormous power it has amassed through earlier consolidation. “If you want to have a monopoly,” he said, “the government can be your best friend.”","In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass. Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate.","In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass. Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate. Mr. Hollande, for example, has an ordinance that requires rent-to-own landlords to adhere to building, housing and safety codes, as well as to remove women from some news photographs. “The ultra-Orthodox have increasingly seen gender separation as a kind of litmus test of Atlanta civic pride.

But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump’s military threats against North Korea have caught Beijing’s attention, Mr. Revere said. But he added, “That possibility is not there at this time.” For now, the fight is theoretical.

"MOSCOW — Two Chechens, one a police officer who fought Islamic insurgents and the second a security guard, were charged in a Moscow court on Sunday in connection with the killing of Boris Y. Nemtsov, a leading Kremlin critic, while three other suspects were jailed pending further investigation. Judge Nataliya Mushnikova of Basmanny District Court said that the officer, Zaur Dadayev, had confessed to involvement in the killing and that other evidence confirmed his participation, Russian news agencies reported, but no further details were available. The second suspect charged, Anzor Gubashev, pleaded not guilty. Despite the court appearances, neither the court nor Russian law enforcement agencies presented coherent pictures of the case thus far, including the roles played by the suspects or any motive they might have had. Mr. Dadayev and Mr. Gubashev, whose arrests were announced on Saturday by Russia’s top law enforcement official, are believed to be the two directly involved in fatally shooting  Mr. Nemtsov on Feb. 27. The three other suspects who appeared in court on Sunday, accused of being accomplices, were Mr. Gubashev’s younger brother, Shagid, a truck driver; Khamzad Bakhaev; and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov, the official Tass news agency reported. All five were jailed for up to two months. The main question many Russians want answered is who ordered the brazen assassination of Mr. Nemtsov, 55, a former deputy prime minister turned opposition leader. Since the shooting took place within sight of the Kremlin, among the most heavily guarded sites in Moscow, opposition figures have accused the government of complicity, which it has denied. The Kremlin had previously suggested that the killing was the work of foreign spy agencies, but President Vladimir V. Putin later said it was politically motivated. Mr. Nemtsov was one of the government’s most persistent critics and was due to publish a report that he said would reveal the involvement of the Russian military in the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has called Russians fighting in Ukraine “volunteers.” Given the intense national interest in the case, the arrival of the men in court was broadcast on state television. Uniformed security agents wearing black balaclavas frog-marched the suspects, bent over and wearing handcuffs, into the courthouse. Security forces established a tight cordon around it. A sixth suspect blew himself up with a hand grenade on Saturday night as the police closed in on his apartment in the southern city of Grozny, the capital of the Republic of Chechnya, the Interfax news agency reported. The arrests and the police activity were centered in the troubled North Caucasus, where Russia has battled Islamic insurgents since 1994. At some point, Mr. Dadayev was the deputy commander of the North battalion of Interior Ministry troops in Chechnya, state-run news agencies reported, but it was not clear if he still held that post. He even won a commendation for bravery, according to Caucasian Knot, a website that focuses on news from the region. The fact that Mr. Dadayev served in a force founded by Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic and the man given a Kremlin mandate to run Chechnya as he liked after stamping out the insurgency, suggests that the plot was purely domestic, said Grigory S. Shvedov, the editor in chief of Caucasian Knot. “More security people are working in Chechnya than in any other region in Russia,” Mr. Shvedov said in an interview. “Why would anyone try to recruit a killer who works for Kadyrov? It would be long and complicated.” Albert Barakhoev, the acting head of the Security Council in Ingushetia, a region that borders Chechnya, was quoted by the state-run news agencies, Tass and RIA Novosti, as saying the arrests took place there. The two main suspects, Mr. Dadayev and Mr. Gubashev, are between 30 and 35, he said, and have been in Moscow for years. Mr. Gubashev had worked for a private security company in Moscow as a guard in a hypermarket, Mr. Barakhoev said. Ajmani Dadayev, the mother of Mr. Dadayev, told state television that the two Gubashev brothers were her nephews. The Interfax news agency, quoting an unidentified source, said the police had been able to trace the first two men through cellphone activity around the location of the killing and from DNA evidence found in the suspected getaway car. There have been a series of high-profile murders of government critics in Russia over the past two decades in which the mastermind was never identified. Last June, for example, Moscow’s highest criminal court sentenced five men from the North Caucasus to prison for the 2006 murder of the investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a scathing critic of Kremlin policies in Chechnya and of Mr. Kadyrov. But her supporters say the identity of who ordered her killing remains unsolved.","MOSCOW — Two Chechens, one a police officer who fought Islamic insurgents and the second a security guard, were charged in a Moscow court on Sunday in connection with the killing of Boris Y.

"INDIANAPOLIS — Twenty-five years ago, when Connecticut began its ascent to the summit of women’s college basketball, the program resembled the current Oregon State team, which unexpectedly captured the Dallas Region this season to reach its first Final Four. If the Beavers can replicate UConn’s success, solace can be found after the Huskies dominated them, 80-51, on Sunday in the N.C.A.A. tournament semifinals at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. UConn’s Morgan Tuck scored a game-high 21 points. Breanna Stewart, who won her third straight national player of the year award on Saturday, finished with 16 points and 8 rebounds. “It’s hard to not be impressed by the things that Morgan Tuck did in that first-half run that we had,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. In 1991, UConn reached its first Final Four, losing to Virginia in the semifinals. Since that defeat, the Huskies have reached 16 additional Final Fours, including the last nine. A victory in Tuesday’s championship game would result in UConn’s fourth straight national title and 11th over all. Before Auriemma arrived in Storrs, UConn was an anonymous program. Postseason tournaments were foreign territory.  When Beavers Coach Scott Rueck took over at Oregon State, his alma mater, in 2010, the team occupied a space almost beyond obscurity. The previous coach, LaVonda Wagner, was fired amid allegations by players that she had verbally abused them, among other problems, and most of the team fled Corvallis. Rueck held open tryouts to fill a roster that came to include soccer and volleyball players. “It’s really exciting, the future,” Beavers center Ruth Hamblin said after the game. “I think we just set the bar high.” Rueck had come from Division III George Fox University in Newberg, Ore., where he constructed his program in the Connecticut mold. He said last week that he would pore over team stats, comparing George Fox’s rankings in Division III categories with where UConn stood in Division I. In 2009, Rueck led George Fox to a 32-0 record and the national title.  With Sunday’s victory, Connecticut moved to 37-0. It was the Huskies’ 74th consecutive victory over all, and it extended their streak of N.C.A.A. tournament wins to a record 23. The Beavers did not enter the game overwhelmed by the task before them. At one point during warm-ups, the team paused and coolly tried to stack eight basketballs at once in the hoop.  But when the game tipped off, the ball went through the net less frequently, and the Huskies quickly demonstrated the chasm that separated the programs. Tuck scored 10 of Connecticut’s first 15 points as the Huskies built a 9-point lead. Despite Tuck’s hot start, UConn faced a potentially perilous situation early when Stewart picked up her second foul just 2 minutes 5 seconds into the game. But Oregon State did not regularly challenge her on defense to draw a third foul, and UConn made nine of its first 12 shots to lead after the first quarter, 26-17. Stewart was held scoreless over the first 17 minutes and had 2 points on two field-goal attempts as UConn led at the half, 47-26.  “Yeah, I wanted to take her out,” Auriemma said, referring to Stewart and her early foul trouble. “And she looked at me and she said: ‘I got it. I’m all right.’ ” Despite Stewart’s unusually spotty contributions in the first half, compensation came by way of the reserves Napheesa Collier and Gabby Williams. The pair combined for 10 points, 4 steals and a stream of blocks, offensive rebounds and charges taken that propelled the Huskies to close the second quarter on a 15-2 run. When Oregon State guard Jamie Weisner missed a layup at the buzzer, she tossed the ball in the air in frustration. “I think what most impressed me was how destructive they were on defense and even offense,” Stewart said of Collier and Williams. Sydney Wiese led Oregon State with 13 points, but the Beavers could never put together strong runs — only once did they make three baskets in a row. Eighteen turnovers further sabotaged their cause, and UConn never trailed. “They can hit from everywhere,” Weisner said. “People come off the bench, and there’s no lag. They expose every weakness and make you pay for it, force you to do things you don’t want to do.” Despite a crisp first half, UConn received troubling news when it was determined that the freshman starter Katie Lou Samuelson had broken a bone in her left foot. She returned to the bench area early in the third quarter wearing a walking boot.  After the game, Auriemma guessed that the injury had happened on one of UConn’s first possessions, when Samuelson drove to the basket, but she continued to play on. “It wasn’t until late in the first half that we found out that there was something wrong,” Auriemma said. “Then, by halftime, when we were in the locker room, we knew that when she wasn’t back in the locker room right away, it had to be something.” Without Samuelson at forward, Stewart took over on offense, going 6 for 8 from the field in the second half, during which UConn led by as many as 34 points. When Stewart exited the game with 2:48 remaining, having helped her team claw within a victory of her fourth national championship, she walked over to Samuelson on the bench and rubbed her head, which elicited a smile. “I think my thoughts coming off the bench was just being there to kind of comfort her,” Stewart said. “I don’t know how much it’s going to help, but kind of giving her the idea that we got this.”","INDIANAPOLIS — Twenty-five years ago, when Connecticut began its ascent to the summit of women’s college basketball, the program resembled the current Oregon State team, which unexpectedly captured the Dallas Region this season to reach its first Final Four.

Roosevelt, who enacted the New Deal and vanquished fascism in Europe and Japan, said the presidency was primarily a place for moral leadership. “The presidency is a serious job that requires sound judgment and good ideas, and there’s a lot of money. Nazi agents started following him. In his Prague hotel room, he met terrified parents desperate to get their children to safety, although it meant surrendering them to strangers in a foreign land. As their numbers grew, a storefront office was opened. Long lines attracted tournament final at Lucas Oil Stadium. “I don't know how you can be any better than we were down the stretch,” said Krzyzewski, who earned his fifth championship, moving him alone into second place behind John Wooden (10). It came against the odds, with his team sputtering out of halftime and Wisconsin — in an arena heavily tilted toward the Badgers’side — appearing ready to pull away. Okafor picked up his fourth foul, casting him to the bench, and the Blue Devils turned to Jones and Grayson Allen, an oft-overlooked reserve guard, to stir up the offense. In the huddle, Krzyzewski pleaded for more activity, less standing around. “Start playing,” he told them last May. Two days after the dueling decisions, conservatives seized on another comment. Jonathan Gruber, a former health care adviser to the Obama administration, meddling in American presidential politics by hacking the Democratic Party’s embrace of free trade and left behind by the forces of globalization and big business, he said. According to tournament across the state line in Lowell, Mass., Mr. Clinton did not bring up his onetime friend’s recent attacks on Mr. Clinton’s history is a legitimate criticism, though Mrs. Fiorina said she doubted voters would care. Mr. Clinton, after all, is someone for whom leaving the security of Trump Tower and moving to Washington and the White House was a daunting prospect. Even now, as he has grown more comfortable in the job, he rarely leaves the White House unless he is certain the environment will be friendly, such as at one of his own properties. Rallies are rarely scheduled in areas that could invite large protests. For months, aides were mostly able to redirect a neophyte president with warnings about the consequences of his actions, and mostly control his public behavior."
"President Trump on Friday intensified his attacks on his own Justice Department and F.B.I. for their handling of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections, hinting that senior leaders there should face consequences for conduct he called “a disgrace.” Mr. Trump, who has become increasingly outspoken in his suggestions of wrongdoing by law enforcement officials as the inquiry has reached deeper inside the White House, made his comments as he announced that he had declassified a secret memo prepared by House Republicans that insinuates that the Russia investigation has been tainted by Democratic bias. “I think it’s terrible,” Mr. Trump said of the actions described by the document, which accuses federal law enforcement officials of abusing their authority when they sought permission to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. “It’s a disgrace what’s happening in our country,” Mr. Trump added. “A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, and much worse than that.” The release of the memo raised fresh questions about whether Mr. Trump — who last year fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director overseeing the Russia inquiry, and then sought to remove Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel named to take it over — might seek next to oust Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who named Mr. Mueller. The president, who first considered getting rid of Mr. Rosenstein last summer, pointedly refused to say on Friday whether he was more likely to do so now, cocking his head and telling reporters who pressed him on the matter: “You figure that out.” But the release of the memo underscored how Mr. Trump has transformed his own suspicions and unsubstantiated theories about an inquiry he has repeatedly called a “hoax” and a “witch hunt” into a set of official accusations of corruption against the very people investigating him. The president has called for months for the compilation of such evidence, often taking to Twitter to demand that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. release information that could show political bias on the part of those investigating whether his campaign colluded with Russia. Last month, Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who leads the Intelligence Committee and is a loyal ally of Mr. Trump, obliged by dispatching his staff to compile a classified document that seeks to illustrate just that. Mr. Trump was eager to release it. The memo described Mr. Rosenstein as one of the senior Justice Department officials who approved an application to extend surveillance of Mr. Page, and suggested that those applications deliberately avoided mentioning that they were based in part on information in a dossier paid for by Democrats. A senior White House official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the president’s thinking, said there had been no consideration or discussion of dismissing Mr. Rosenstein, and that the material in the memo had not altered Mr. Trump’s view of him. Still, the prospect of Mr. Rosenstein’s ouster set off alarms among Democrats, who said it would be an unacceptable move by the president to thwart a federal investigation. “We write to inform you that we would consider such an unwarranted action as an attempt to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation,” Democratic leaders said in a letter to Mr. Trump shortly after he made his comments at the White House on Friday morning. “Firing Rod Rosenstein, D.O.J. leadership, or Bob Mueller could result in a constitutional crisis of the kind not seen since the Saturday Night Massacre,” they wrote. They were referring to President Nixon’s order at the height of the Watergate scandal to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor. Elliot Richardson, the attorney general, and William Ruckelshaus, the deputy attorney general, resigned rather than carry out the order. In a morning tweet before the release of the memo, Mr. Trump said senior officials had corrupted the Russia inquiry with partisan bias. “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans — something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. He also circulated a quotation from Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative-aligned group Judicial Watch, who last year said the Obama administration had turned the F.B.I. into a “K.G.B.-type operation.” On Friday, in a statement retweeted by the president, Mr. Fitton accused Hillary Clinton and Democrats of trying to hide the fact that they had funded the dossier, which, he said, “was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the Trump Team.” In an afternoon statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the memo “raises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. to use the government’s most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.” Later on Friday, Mr. Trump visited a Customs and Border Protection training center to urge passage of an immigration overhaul before flying to Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Senior officials at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. had strenuously objected to the Republican memo, arguing that it omitted key facts, a case that Mr. Rosenstein and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, made to Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday. But on Friday, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, appeared to side with critics of the Justice Department. “Congress has made inquiries concerning an issue of great importance for the country, and concerns have been raised about the department’s performance,” Mr. Sessions said in a statement. “I have great confidence in the men and women of this department. But no department is perfect.” Earlier, during an event at the Justice Department on Friday morning, Mr. Sessions veered off script to praise Mr. Rosenstein, a 27-year veteran of the agency, whom he said represents “the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.” But some conservatives quickly seized on the declassified memo as grounds to dismiss Mr. Rosenstein. The Tea Party Patriots, a political group, produced a dramatic television ad calling him “a weak careerist at the Justice Department, protecting liberal Obama holdovers and the deep state instead of following the rule of law.” It said he should do his job or resign. Should Mr. Trump opt to act on the allegations in the memo, Mr. Rosenstein might not be the only senior official affected. Among the other officials mentioned as having approved the applications to extend the surveillance warrant was Dana Boente, who briefly acted as assistant attorney general in the National Security Division before being named as the general counsel at the F.B.I. Earlier this week, Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I., abruptly left after Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, confronted him about an investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector general into the events of 2016, when the bureau was investigating both Mrs. Clinton’s email use and the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia.","President Trump on Friday intensified his attacks on his own Justice Department and F.B.I. for their handling of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections, hinting that senior leaders there should face consequences for conduct he called “a disgrace.” Mr. Trump, who has become increasingly outspoken in his suggestions of wrongdoing by law enforcement officials as the inquiry has reached deeper inside the White House, made his comments as he announced that he had declassified a secret memo prepared by House Republicans that insinuates that the Russia investigation has been tainted by Democratic bias.","President Trump on Friday intensified his attacks on his own Justice Department and F.B.I. for their handling of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections, hinting that senior leaders there should face consequences for conduct he called “a disgrace.” Mr. Trump, who has become increasingly outspoken in his suggestions of wrongdoing by law enforcement officials as the inquiry has reached deeper inside the White House, made his comments as he announced that he had declassified a secret memo prepared by House Republicans that insinuates that the Russia investigation has been tainted by Democratic bias. “I think it’s appropriate,” he said. “You have to nominate people who can actually win because winners make policy and losers go home.” He added a few moments later, she said: “The federation was created by an act of Parliament.

The analysis culminated in a 728-page report, released in March 2015, that showed how few consumers went to arbitration once they “I think it would be very bad for this White House.” _________ The ability of different Fox News programs to lurch between news and opinion was demonstrated clearly when it came to Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California. “But I did not go to him,” Ms. Troiani testified. “He initiated the contact,” she added. “But I say he’s got bias.

"WASHINGTON — In a speech on Friday to world and financial leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump mixed facts, falsehoods and claims that could use context. Below are some statements from the speech about the economy and Mr. Trump’s place in history. The economy has added almost 2.4 million jobs in the 14 months since Mr. Trump was elected in November 2016 — but it is worth noting that this number includes the last three months of Barack Obama’s presidency. Also, as a point of comparison, the economy added 2.8 million jobs in the 14 months before Mr. Trump’s election. During the first 11 full months of Mr. Trump’s presidency, 1.8 million jobs were added. And in the 11 months before he was inaugurated, 2.1 million jobs were added. It is also debatable whether Mr. Trump, or any first-year president, can take full credit for a strong economy (or be censured, were it to happen, for weak economic performance). As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained: “If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no. If you think that what really matters is the mood in the executive suite, then just maybe.” The $1.5 trillion tax cut enacted in December does not amount to the largest in history, nor is Mr. Trump the first president to pass tax cuts since President Ronald Reagan. President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W. Bush enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under Mr. Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and he later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Mr. Reagan’s 1981 tax cut, Mr. Obama’s stimulus package and extensions of Mr. Bush’s tax cuts would all place ahead of Mr. Trump’s tax cut as a share of the economy and in inflation-adjusted dollars. Several presidents have owned, operated or worked in the field of business. Most immediately, George Bush and George W. Bush both owned several oil companies based out of Texas. The latter was also part of an ownership group that purchased the Texas Rangers baseball team. Jimmy Carter owned a peanut farm and some other real estate in Georgia. Herbert Hoover became wealthy after founding a mining engineer consultancy. Warren Harding was the owner and publisher of a newspaper. Calvin Coolidge worked for a bank. Teddy Roosevelt owned and operated a ranch in the Dakotas Territory. Looking further back, George Washington, James Madison and James Monroe all owned plantations. Mr. Trump is right that the unemployment rates for women and minorities are at or near historic lows. But it’s worth noting that these rates had been steadily declining for years by the time he took office. For black Americans, the unemployment rate of 6.8 percent in December was the lowest ever recorded, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It had already decreased to 7.8 percent in January 2017 from over 15 percent in 2010. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and it remained at that level in December. The Latino unemployment rate declined to 4.9 percent in December from 5.9 percent in January 2017, the second lowest — not the lowest, as Mr. Trump said — on record. It reached 4.8 percent in June, October and November 2017, as well as in October 2006 under George W. Bush. The 4.0 percent unemployment rate for women in December is among the lowest in 17 years, as Mr. Trump said. It was lower in October at 3.9 percent, down from 4.8 percent in January 2017. Mr. Trump is most likely referring to the rise in the Wilshire 5000 Index, a widely used metric. The index grew to 29,431.74 on Wednesday, from 22,165.78 points on Election Day 2016, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a gain of more than 7,200 points. A single point on the index represents $1.15 billion, so the market has added $8.3 trillion since Mr. Trump’s election. But these gains in wealth have disproportionally benefited Americans by income bracket. Roughly half of Americans do not own stock directly or in retirement accounts and mutual funds, and the richest 10 percent of households controlled 84 percent of the total value of stocks, a recent study by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research estimated. Buoyed by stock market growth, net household wealth increased to $96.9 trillion in the third quarter of 2017 from $91.7 trillion in the last quarter of 2016, according to the latest data available from the Federal Reserve. Pentagon officials have recently declared the defeat of the physical “caliphate” and said the Islamic State has lost nearly all of its territory in Iraq and Syria. At its peak in January 2015, the jihadist group controlled 35,000 square miles of territory in the Middle East. By the time Mr. Trump took office in January 2017, their holdings had shrunk to about 23,000 square miles. It further dwindled to  2,500 square miles in January 2018, according to IHS Markit, a research firm that has tracked territory held by the Islamic State. So while fighting has certainly escalated under Mr. Trump, the Islamic State had begun losing territory under Mr. Obama, and experts have cited this trend and the efforts of local troops when analyzing whom to credit for these gains. “It’s a fight for who’s going to give the most,” Mr. Trump said. “It started at $1,000, and now we have them up to $3,000.” More than 260 companies have announced employee bonuses, raises or investments since the tax bill was passed in December, according to an anecdotal list compiled by Americans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates lower taxes. The group’s president, Grover Norquist, worked with the White House to develop the legislation. Many have said they will give one-time employee bonuses of $1,000 to $2,000. According to the list, only one, a private insurance company, announced $3,000 bonuses for 700 employees in a news release on Dec. 21, the day before Mr. Trump signed the tax bill. It’s worth noting that most of these businesses are financial institutions and, as my colleague Jim Tankersley has reported, “The payouts to workers reflect a small slice of the windfall that banks large and small are in line to receive.”","WASHINGTON — In a speech on Friday to world and financial leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump mixed facts, falsehoods and claims that could use context.

"WASHINGTON — By any measure, President Obama’s effort to train a Syrian opposition army to fight the Islamic State on the ground has been an abysmal failure. The military acknowledged this week that just four or five American-trained fighters are actually fighting. But the White House says it is not to blame. The finger, it says, should be pointed not at Mr. Obama but at those who pressed him to attempt training Syrian rebels in the first place — a group that, in addition to congressional Republicans, happened to include former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. At briefings this week after the disclosure of the paltry results, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, repeatedly noted that Mr. Obama always had been a skeptic of training Syrian rebels. The military was correct in concluding that “this was a more difficult endeavor than we assumed and that we need to make some changes to that program,” Mr. Earnest said. “But I think it’s also time for our critics to ‘fess up in this regard as well. They were wrong.” In effect, Mr. Obama is arguing that he reluctantly went along with those who said it was the way to combat the Islamic State, but that he never wanted to do it and has now has been vindicated in his original judgment. The I-told-you-so argument, of course, assumes that the idea of training rebels itself was flawed and not that it was started too late and executed ineffectively, as critics maintain. Either way, it underscored White House sensitivities about the widening Syrian catastrophe. With more than 200,000 killed in the civil war, a wave of refugees flooding into Europe, and Russia now flying in arms and troops, the president finds himself with a geopolitical and humanitarian mess that will most likely not be settled before he leaves office in 16 months. Mr. Obama has long considered Syria a quagmire that defies American solutions, and aides are hoping to keep him from being held responsible for something that, they argue, he never really had the power to fix. But with images of drowned children and Russian tanks, the president has come under increasing fire from multiple directions. The Russians accuse him of making the crisis worse by opposing the autocratic government of President Bashar al-Assad in its fight against terrorists like the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL. Republicans accuse him of passivity and fecklessness, of sitting back while the conflict spread across the region. But there is no consensus among critics about what should be done. During back-to-back presidential debates on Wednesday night, Republican candidates were divided between those advocating more American involvement and those suggesting stepping back and letting the Syrians fight it out themselves. “I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said. “Well, the president didn’t listen, the administration didn’t follow through and that’s exactly what happened. That is why ISIS grew.” Donald J. Trump, the businessman, and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky went the other direction, embracing disengagement. “Syria’s a mess,” Mr. Trump said. “Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.”  Mr. Paul added, “Sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention makes us less safe.” The idea of bolstering Syrian rebels was debated from the early days of the civil war, which started in 2011. Mrs. Clinton, along with David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director, and Leon E. Panetta, then the defense secretary, supported arming opposition forces, but the president worried about deep entanglement in someone else’s war after the bloody experience in Iraq. In 2014, however, after the Islamic State had swept through parts of Syria and Iraq, Mr. Obama reversed course and initiated a $500 million program to train and arm rebels who had been vetted and were told to fight the Islamic State, not Mr. Assad’s government. The program was financed last December and started in May with the goal of training 5,400 in the first year, but military officials said only 100 to 120 had actually been trained. The first 54 graduates suffered a devastating attack by a Qaeda affiliate in July, forcing the Pentagon to draw up plans to revamp the program by dropping larger numbers of fighters into safer parts of Syria. Appearing at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, head of the United States Central Command, conceded that only four or five trained rebels were actually fighting now. “We have to acknowledge that this is a total failure,” Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said in response. “It’s just a failure. I wish it weren’t so, but that’s the fact. It’s time to — way past time to react to that failure.” Military officials said the few trained rebels might still prove useful in specific roles, like calling in American airstrikes. But the military has had better results from working with Kurdish forces who have stepped up to fill the place of American-trained Syrians on the ground, first at Sinjar, then at Kobani and most recently in the stretch of Syria south of the Turkish border from the Euphrates River to the Iraqi border. The White House all but washed its hands of the training program after General Austin’s testimony. “It is true that we have found this to be a difficult challenge,” Mr. Earnest said. “But it is also true that many of our critics had proposed this specific option as essentially the cure-all for all of the policy challenges that we’re facing in Syria right now. That is not something that this administration ever believed, but it is something that our critics will have to answer for.” Some of those critics said the program failed because it was delayed and limited. “The White House plan is two-plus years late and fundamentally flawed because it restricts volunteers from fighting against Assad, which is their priority objective,” said Gen. Jack Keane, a retired Army vice chief of staff. Some Syrian rebels who asked for American arms in 2011 and 2012 eventually gave up and allied themselves with more radical groups, analysts said, leaving fewer fighters who were friendly to the United States. “The reason it failed is because we got the politics wrong,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Ryan C. Crocker, a retired career diplomat who was an ambassador to Afghanistan under Mr. Obama, said the president was right to think a train-and-arm program would not work. But the president, Mr. Crocker added, should have either continued to resist it or at least taken ownership of it rather than blame others for its failure. “How un-presidential that sounds — ‘We didn’t want to do it, we thought it was unsound but you made us do it,’ ” said Mr. Crocker, now dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. “It’s just indicative of their whole approach to Syria, which is not to have a policy. This is the worst thing they could say.”","WASHINGTON — By any measure, President Obama’s effort to train a Syrian opposition army to fight the Islamic State on the ground has been an abysmal failure.

But after Cain walked to begin the inning and stole second base, Hosmer doubled into the left-field corner to cut the Mets’lead to 2-1, and Familia, the closer, relieved Harvey.

"When Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh introduced himself to the American people on Monday, with a beaming President Trump beside him, he had a lot to say about his mother, a former high school teacher and a Maryland judge. He accorded his father strikingly less attention — just 34 words, compared with 132 about his mother — mentioning his “unparalleled work ethic” while not saying exactly what work he did. Yet Ed Kavanaugh’s career may shed light on his son’s hostility to government regulation, a major reason conservatives are so enthralled by his nomination to the Supreme Court. He spent more than two decades in Washington as a top lobbyist for the cosmetics industry, courting Congress and combating regulations from the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies. (Among his hires for legal work: John G. Roberts Jr., now the chief justice.) In current parlance, as an old friend put it, the elder Mr. Kavanaugh and his associates were “swamp creatures,” using money and connections to fend off demands for safer products and greater transparency about ingredients. He was a golf partner of Tip O’Neill, the longtime Democratic House speaker, who weighed in to support Martha Kavanaugh’s nomination to a judgeship. He was paid $13 million, including his retirement package, in 2005, his last year at the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, records show. Now Brett Kavanaugh, should he be confirmed, will cement a solid pro-business majority on the nation’s highest court, advancing Mr. Trump’s aim of dismantling the regulatory state, liberating industry from what he sees as burdensome rules. With critical battles over the environment and consumer protection headed for the courts, his ascent would likely achieve for industry incomparably more than all his father’s years of lobbying. That is clearly the White House’s hope: An official fact sheet declares that “Judge Kavanaugh protects American businesses from illegal job-killing regulations” and — in an unusual claim about a judge — “has led the effort to rein in unaccountable independent agencies.” It is also one reason his confirmation is opposed by many advocates for consumers, environmental protection and workers. But as with any nominee, Judge Kavanaugh and his supporters are carefully shaping his narrative for the diverse Senate and the broader American public: his mother the judge, not his father the lobbyist; his parents’ early struggles, not their second homes in the Florida Keys and on Maryland’s Eastern Shore; his service as a children’s sports coach and a Catholic volunteer, not his participation in some of the most bitter partisan fights in recent times. They do not let on that Judge Kavanaugh is by legacy and experience a charter member of elite Washington: His family’s government-centric social circle, his two summer jobs on Capitol Hill, his White House service, his golfing at the capital’s country clubs, his residence in one of the richest suburban enclaves in America. Nor do they note that Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is the culmination of a 30-year conservative movement to shift the judiciary to the right. In retrospect, his climb to a justice’s seat may seem calculated — from pursuing jobs that put him close to the nation’s most powerful men to the moment he raised some eyebrows by praising Mr. Trump for the breadth of his candidate search (“No president has ever consulted more widely…”). Although the president talked with many people about his choices, he selected Judge Kavanaugh from a list compiled with the guidance of conservative activists. Yet by many accounts, the conservative combatant of the Bill Clinton investigation and the 2000 Florida recount who has spent a dozen years as an appellate judge is also a generous friend, including to many Democrats; an authentic sports fanatic who keeps a beat-up basketball in his chambers; and a warmhearted family man. This examination of Mr. Kavanaugh’s personal life and career is drawn from interviews with more than 60 people who know him and a review of his judicial opinions, speeches and other public records. Law clerks recall his carrying a tattered index card in his shirt pocket with life maxims like those he urged in a speech to Catholic University law graduates in May: “Love your friends, live on the sunrise side of the mountain and stay humble.” In the confirmation fight just getting underway, his opponents will discover plenty in his record not to like, but those who know him say they may find it a challenge to vilify him personally. Greg Chernack, chairman of the town council in the Kavanaughs’ neighborhood outside Washington, said the Supreme Court nominee was a regular at community events, chatting about his love for the Nationals and Bruce Springsteen. Mr. Chernack, a lawyer, said he found Mr. Trump “reprehensible” and had concerns about the judiciary. Of Mr. Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy, he said, “We disagree on things.” Still, he said of Mr. Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley, who is the town manager, “I think the world of both of them.” He was an only child but had a pack of friends, who remember riding bikes, buying baseball cards and playing in Catholic youth basketball games. He attended all-male Catholic schools, winning the headmaster’s award in seventh grade and saving his parents a year’s tuition. During his junior high and high school summers, he had a one-man business cutting neighbors’ lawns. Still, he was a son of privilege, at least by his teenage years, when his parents’ careers took off. His parents were featured in a 1985 Washington Post Magazine article about working with an interior designer to redecorate their brick Colonial, using tiles Ed Kavanaugh picked up in Portugal for a custom-made dining table and purchasing vases and a gilt wood carving from Hong Kong. And the family was deeply tied to official Washington. “He’s a fellow child of a D.C. mover and shaker,” Elvis Oxley, the son of Michael G. Oxley, a Republican former House member from Ohio, said of the judge. Elvis Oxley later went to work for the same cosmetics lobby Ed Kavanaugh had. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has sometimes traced the roots of his conservative politics to his early teenage years, when he took an interest in his mother’s work as a local prosecutor at home and the Iran hostage crisis abroad. He liked what President Ronald Reagan said about national security, cementing his allegiance to the Republican Party at an early age. (His father is a registered Republican; his mother registered as a Democrat but later signed on as a Republican in Florida.) Friends say he has not fundamentally changed his views since then. Inspired by some of his teachers, Mr. Kavanaugh briefly considered becoming a history teacher and coach when he finished a bachelor’s degree in history at Yale, where his grandfather had graduated in 1929. But as a teenager he had been captivated by his mother’s tales of bank robberies and police sleuthing, and for years Mr. Kavanaugh wanted to be a prosecutor too. So he went straight on to Yale Law School in 1987, sharing a run-down New Haven house with seven other students, most of them Democrats. “The house was so nasty that all the college frats had turned it down as unsanitary,” he recalled in a commencement speech this year at Catholic University’s law school. The friends left their doors open and wandered in and out of one another’s rooms, and the house was known for its parties. Despite the socializing, said Jim Brochin, one of the tight group of housemates and now a lawyer in New York, “You knew right away that he was a very industrious person and student.” Mr. Kavanaugh’s talents did not always stand out at Yale, where his class was full of academic stars and would produce several federal judges. One of them, James E. Boasberg, now a United States District Court judge in Washington appointed by President Barack Obama, lived in the house and remains a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh. Even before Mr. Kavanaugh took a seat in George Priest’s classroom to study antitrust law, the two had gotten to know each other on Yale’s basketball courts, first playing in pickup games. Throughout Mr. Kavanaugh’s life, being “obsessed” with sports, a friend said, has helped him bond with others. “I have played a lot of basketball with him,” said Professor Priest, whose role in the younger man’s rise in conservative legal circles would prove crucial. “You learn a lot about the character of a person by playing basketball with him. He is an incredibly decent person.” Professor Priest, a longtime sponsor of Yale’s chapter of the Federalist Society, described his former student as “slightly conservative,” but not an outspoken activist. In interviews, friends and classmates agreed with that characterization, saying they knew Mr. Kavanaugh leaned rightward but couldn’t recall his arguing his views or even sharing them much. “We knew his politics were probably more conservative than the rest of the members of the group, but it was not a topic of frequent discussion,” Mr. Brochin said. “He was not strident in the views he held. It was clear that civility was important to him.” Nonetheless, Judge Kavanaugh’s minority status at liberal Yale affected him. In a talk last year to the American Enterprise Institute about William H. Rehnquist, the conservative chief justice during Judge Kavanaugh’s law school years, he described himself at the time as a lonely crusader for the right. “In class after class, I stood with Rehnquist,” Judge Kavanaugh said. “That often meant, in the Yale Law School environment of the time, that I stood alone.” He was more religious than a typical law school student of the era and he attended Mass on Sundays. “As long as I’ve known him, it has been a part of his life,” Mr. Brochin said. In a testament to Judge Kavanaugh’s devotion to friends, every year for 27 years the former housemates have gathered for reunions, going rafting or biking, taking in spring training or the World Series. Even as he has held a string of high-powered positions, Judge Kavanaugh has changed very little, Mr. Brochin said. “He was always very ambitious, in a good way — he was very good at positioning himself at the right place and with the right people,” he said. “He is very much the same person.” At Yale, Mr. Kavanaugh developed relationships with several prominent professors who had reputations for helping students win coveted judicial clerkships — visiting during office hours and asking for recommendations. He interviewed for a clerkship with a liberal judge, but ultimately landed one with a conservative, Judge Walter Stapleton, a Delaware federal appeals court judge who was not considered a “feeder” — a judge whose clerks had a realistic shot at a prestigious Supreme Court clerkship. He was working for Judge Stapleton in the spring of 1991 when a major abortion rights case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, came before his court. Judge Stapleton wrote the majority opinion, which upheld many provisions of a strict Pennsylvania abortion law that a district court judge had struck down. (A representative of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation team declined to comment on whether he had been involved in the opinion.) The next year, he took the unusual step of accepting a second appeals court clerkship. Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit, a conservative known as a difficult boss but whose chambers were a launching pad for a Supreme Court clerkship, had an opening for a clerk and turned to Professor Priest, a friend, for suggestions. “I called Kavanaugh and asked him, ‘Do you want to do another clerkship?’” Professor Priest recalled. The match was made. “He thought Brett was just fantastic,” Professor Priest said of Judge Kozinski. Friends say the job marked Judge Kavanaugh’s rise to legal stardom and honed his conservatism to focus on the exact words of the Constitution, which he would later call “a document of majestic specificity.” The clerkship wasn’t easy. “When we started as law clerks, he told us we work for the people and we should consider ourselves on the job 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year,” Judge Kavanaugh testified during his 2006 confirmation hearing. “And I can say from personal experience that Judge Kozinski lived up to that promise.” (Judge Kozinski retired last year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, and some opponents of Judge Kavanaugh have questioned whether he knew or should have known about the abuse. A spokeswoman said he never heard any sexual harassment allegations against Judge Kozinski until they surfaced publicly last year.) Shooting for the highest rungs of the legal world, he applied to clerk for Chief Justice Rehnquist. He has told colleagues that he scored an interview, though he did not get the job. Mr. Kavanaugh went on to a fellowship in the solicitor general’s office, which argues for the government before the Supreme Court. But his work with Judge Kozinski eventually paid off: He did get a Supreme Court clerkship. It was with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose seat he has now been nominated to fill. By the time Mr. Kavanaugh completed his clerkship, his glittering résumé and professional networking were opening doors. Kenneth W. Starr, his boss in the solicitor general’s office, recruited him to the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. But before he could start a private-sector career, Mr. Starr recruited him for another role: in the independent counsel’s office, then gearing up to investigate the Clinton administration. Mr. Starr assured Mr. Kavanaugh that the job would last six months, maybe a year, Mr. Starr recalled. In the end, Mr. Kavanaugh would serve two stints totaling about four years. At first, Mr. Kavanaugh examined the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel. Records from the National Archives show that Mr. Kavanaugh obtained receipts from the hotel that Mr. Foster visited days before his death and collected gruesome notes on the condition of his body. Mr. Starr also assigned Mr. Kavanaugh to argue before the Supreme Court that Mr. Foster’s communications with his lawyers were no longer privileged because he was deceased. In what turned out to be his only appearance before the high court, Mr. Kavanaugh lost. “I was sort of amazed that he was allowed to argue it,” said Craig Lerner, who worked in the independent counsel’s office and is now a professor at George Mason Law School, noting that Mr. Starr could have argued it himself. But, he added, “Brett was the leading member of the brain trust.” In an interview, Mr. Starr recalled that he “was very proud of him.” Mr. Kavanaugh left the office in 1997 for Kirkland but hurried back the next year, after news broke about Mr. Clinton’s affair with a White House intern. Soon, he was helping to draft the portion of the so-called Starr report that identified potential grounds to impeach Mr. Clinton. The report argued that the president could be impeached for lying to his staff and misleading the public — a theory that may prove damaging to Mr. Trump if applied to the current Russia investigation. Mr. Kavanaugh failed to persuade Mr. Starr to remove the narrative portion of the report describing, in explicit detail, Mr. Clinton’s relationship with the intern, Monica Lewinsky, according to people involved in the process. In September 1998, when he heard that Congress was set to publicly release the report without having read it, Mr. Kavanaugh drafted a letter urging congressional leaders to think again. But Mr. Starr, who had already alerted lawmakers that his report contained sensitive material, declined to send the letter. Congress published the report. Friends say Mr. Kavanaugh regretted the publication of the full report, which he felt led to a caricature of the independent counsel’s office reveling in the salacious details of a president’s sex life. “I think when Brett says, ‘I wish we had done more,’ sure, we could have done more, but I thought we did a lot,” recalled Robert Bittman, who had been one of Mr. Starr’s top deputies. “We never thought Congress would abdicate their responsibility and release the report without reading it.” That experience — and the upheaval Mr. Starr’s report caused at the White House — helped crystallize one of Judge Kavanaugh’s most contentious viewpoints: Congress should protect sitting presidents from criminal prosecution so as not to distract them from the critical duties of their office. Judge Kavanaugh’s misgivings about independent prosecutors, articulated in law review articles in 1998 and 2009, reflect a broader deference to presidential power that has infused his career ever since. Senate Democrats have seized on the articles as potential red flags. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has indicated he may subpoena Mr. Trump. If the issue were to end up before the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote. Despite his reservations about independent prosecutors, Judge Kavanaugh has defended Mr. Starr in a series of op-ed articles, calling him “an American hero” and crediting him with uncovering “a massive effort by the president to lie under oath and obstruct justice.” At a November 1999 “Kenneth Starr appreciation dinner” in Washington, Mr. Kavanaugh delivered a glowing speech in which he mused about Mr. Starr’s becoming an ambassador and hoped to one day “call him Mr. Justice Starr.” The feeling is mutual: Mr. Starr has expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Kavanaugh’s nomination. When George W. Bush took office in 2001, his first White House counsel, Alberto R. Gonzales, hired Mr. Kavanaugh as an associate counsel in part because, in an applicant pool filled with well-credentialed Republican lawyers, his experience working for the Starr investigation gave him a niche — dealing with oversight and investigations — Mr. Gonzales recalled in an interview. Mr. Kavanaugh advised the White House on dealing with the investigation into the collapsed energy firm Enron. But much of his time went to judicial nominations, particularly to the D.C. Circuit on which he would later serve. He worked on the candidacy of Miguel Estrada, a prominent conservative who was blocked by Democrats, and he strongly backed nominating John Roberts, later to become chief justice. The night of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Kavanaugh and Brad Berenson, another former Kennedy clerk in the counsel’s office, worked till early morning in American University’s law library researching emergency powers statutes. Though he seems to have had little involvement in the Bush administration’s most controversial counterterrorism programs, his veracity about his involvement in detention policies would later be challenged. At his 2006 judicial confirmation hearing, when asked about notorious legal memos allowing a variety of torture techniques, Mr. Kavanaugh testified that he had not known about them and had had no involvement in “questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.” That statement came under scrutiny the next year, when The Washington Post reported an anecdote about a 2002 White House debate over whether to deny two American citizens — terrorism suspects who were being held as wartime detainees — access to defense lawyers. Because lawsuits challenging the suspects’ indefinite detention were likely to reach the Supreme Court, where Justice Kennedy was a swing vote, Mr. Gonzales consulted both former Kennedy clerks on his staff. Mr. Berenson and Mr. Kavanaugh told him that Justice Kennedy was likely to rule that citizens have a right to lawyers, so they advised that the administration grant that access rather than inviting defeat in the courts. Vice President Dick Cheney’s lawyer, David Addington, opposed that position. Democrats asked whether The Post’s account suggested that Judge Kavanaugh — by then already on the bench — had delivered misleading testimony. Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who was then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, went so far as to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department, though nothing came of it. Judge Kavanaugh’s defenders portrayed that episode as an exception in which he was consulted because of his insights into Justice Kennedy, saying he otherwise had no role in detainee policy. Potentially dovetailing with that account, as late as January 2003 Mr. Cheney — a chief architect of the administration’s post-9/11 national security policies — had apparently not even heard of him. According to Mr. Gonzales’s 2016 memoir, when Mr. Kavanaugh conveyed to the White House President Bush’s instructions on an affirmative action case, Mr. Cheney summoned Mr. Gonzales to his office and sternly asked, “Do you have a Brett Kavanaugh working for you?” Mr. Kavanaugh, who during the Starr investigation had gone to a few parties with the conservative pundit Laura Ingraham, had started dating Mr. Bush’s personal secretary, Ashley Estes. When the two married in 2004, the president and first lady attended the ceremony. By then, Mr. Kavanaugh had left the counsel’s office to become White House staff secretary, a role that controls the flow of papers into and out of the Oval Office. Edward McNally, who worked on homeland security legal issues in the White House, said Mr. Kavanaugh had to ensure that every word of proposed executive orders or speeches was vetted by the relevant agencies before going to the president, sometimes trying to reconcile competing views. “He was regarded as a fair, neutral, straightforward arbiter,” Mr. McNally said. It was a White House colleague, D. Kyle Sampson, who suggested he might make a good judge. After asking whether Mr. Kavanaugh was interested, Mr. Sampson told Mr. Gonzales, who told President Bush, who nominated him to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. But he would stay at the White House for the next three years because Democrats, citing his partisan history, including his work on the Starr investigation, initially blocked his confirmation. In early 2006, while Mr. Kavanaugh was still awaiting confirmation, he and his wife bought their $1.2 million home in the neighborhood Chevy Chase Section 5, where they live today with their two daughters, Margaret and Liza, and a small white dog named Murphy. He makes $220,600 as a federal judge, and Ms. Kavanaugh earns about $60,000 as town manager. Given that pay and his parents’ wealth, the assets he reported last year were surprisingly modest: less than $65,000. (The number excludes the value of his house and retirement account.) By 2006, the American Bar Association, sometimes accused by conservatives of leaning left, had downgraded its 2003 rating of Mr. Kavanaugh as “well qualified” to become a federal judge to merely “qualified.” One of the evaluators found him “sanctimonious” and another “stubborn and immovable.” Several found his experience scant, noting that he had “never tried a case to verdict or judgment.” Those critiques proved no obstacle. After a bipartisan group of senators struck a deal to resolve Democrats’ filibustering of several of President Bush’s judicial nominees, including Mr. Kavanaugh, the confirmation process finally moved forward. At the opening of Mr. Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, noted the nominee’s status as the scion of his lobbyist father, who had retired a year before. “He is deservedly admired by many in this town,” Mr. Hatch said of Ed Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed 57 to 36, with only four Democrats voting in his favor. In his dozen years on the D.C. appeals court, the balance has shifted: Republican appointees initially dominated, but since 2013 they have been outnumbered by Democratic appointees, and Judge Kavanaugh has found himself dissenting more often. His record in the Supreme Court has been exceptional, with the justices adopting positions advanced in his opinions 13 times. Sometimes the Supreme Court sustained his views after hearing an appeal in a case in which he had written an opinion. At other times, it agreed with a position he had advanced, but in separate cases from other courts raising the same issue, often citing Judge Kavanaugh’s earlier opinion. His successes involved cases concerning environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and limits on suits against corporations accused of complicity in human rights abuses abroad. He took almost uniformly conservative positions. When a closely divided Supreme Court agreed with him, its conservatives tended to be in the majority. But the justices also favored his views in several cases by lopsided majorities or unanimously. He was reversed just once, on an environmental case. Writing for a divided three-judge panel, he said the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded its authority in how it held states responsible for air pollution that drifts across their borders and causes harm in downwind states. The Supreme Court ruled by a 6-to-2 vote that the agency’s approach was permissible. Judge Kavanaugh often expressed his views in an unusual format, dissenting from the full (or en banc) court’s decision not to rehear a case decided by a three-judge panel of which he had not been a member. Not all judges approve of such dissents, particularly when they are aimed at eliciting Supreme Court review. “The judge steps out of the robe and into the role of an advocate, urging the Supreme Court to take the case,” Judge A. Raymond Randolph, one of Judge Kavanagh’s current colleagues, wrote in 1992. But Judge Kavanaugh has used such dissents to press his views to several audiences: to the Supreme Court, which pays close attention to them when deciding whether to hear an appeal; to litigants, who have pursued legal strategies that Judge Kavanaugh mapped out; and to the conservative legal movement, which got a detailed account of his views on legal issues not directly before him. A dissent last year did all of those things. A three-judge panel had upheld the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” regulations, and the full D.C. Circuit declined to rehear the case. Judge Kavanaugh used the occasion to set out his views on two issues that are central to the conservative legal agenda: limiting the power of administrative agencies and subjecting regulations involving speech to skeptical First Amendment scrutiny. “The net neutrality rule is unlawful,” he wrote, “because the rule impermissibly infringes on the Internet service providers’ editorial discretion.” In their appeals to the Supreme Court, which are pending, internet service providers and trade associations relied heavily on Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent. He has also been popular with the justices as a feeder judge, sending his law clerks to serve with Supreme Court justices across the ideological spectrum. A small number of feeders provide a large proportion of Supreme Court clerks, and the justices’ reliance on those judges is a mark of respect. Judge Kavanaugh’s main competitor as a feeder in recent years has been Judge Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court by Mr. Obama was blocked by Senate Republicans. The White House first indicated last December that President Trump would consider nominating Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, when it issued a list of potential contenders if another vacancy arose. But back in May 2016, when Donald F. McGahn II, then the top lawyer on the Trump campaign and now the White House counsel, put together the first list of potential Supreme Court picks to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Kavanaugh was not on it. Indeed, none of the 11 candidates on the first list were from inside the Beltway, underscoring Mr. Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” of the establishment. If Judge Kavanaugh was upset by the omission, he gave no public sign of it. Two weeks later, at a conference in early June 2016, he delivered a keynote speech on Justice Scalia and judges’ deference to the administrative state. “I loved the guy,” he said of the conservative icon. “To me he was and remains a hero and a role model.” Judge Kavanaugh praised Justice Scalia’s influential dissents, naming a few that he predicted would someday become law. Then, as if anticipating such a future time, he teased the audience about the conservative positions that might win a majority of the high court — say, with a new appointment. “Can you name some?” he said, chuckling. “Which do you want to become the law of the land? Which do you fear will become the law of the land?”","When Judge Brett M.

"Police Commissioner William J. Bratton and his predecessor, Raymond W. Kelly, opened a war of words on Tuesday, engaging in a raw and apparently spontaneous dispute over the veracity of the New York Police Department’s official tally of shootings and murders. Mr. Bratton challenged Mr. Kelly to substantiate his claim last week that the department was manipulating the statistics to make it appear that New York is safer than it actually is. “Shame on him,” Mr. Bratton said at an unrelated news conference. “Let him back up that accusation,” he added, noting that Mr. Kelly had not provided details on why he believed the department was altering the statistics. “If you’re going to make it, stand up, be a big man, and explain what you’re talking about,” Mr. Bratton said. Mr. Kelly responded a few hours later. During a news conference at the Time Warner Center, the former commissioner gave specifics: He said people suffering graze wounds — as well as those injured by flying glass caused by gunfire — were not always recorded as shooting victims; likewise, wounds suffered by an uncooperative victim were now being labeled self-inflicted. The comments by both men were a sudden and steep escalation in what has been a tense if cordial relationship between the city’s most significant police leaders of the past quarter-century. Mr. Kelly served as commissioner for all 12 years of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s administration after having held the position under Mayor David N. Dinkins; Mr. Bratton, appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, is in his second stint as commissioner as well, after two years in the job under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Kelly’s assertions strike at the heart of one of Mr. de Blasio’s core political arguments — that the city remains safe, despite a more liberal approach to policing — and it appeared timed to undermine the end-of-year police statistics that the mayor has been trumpeting. The dispute arose after a radio interview recorded this month, when Mr. Kelly suggested that there were “some issues” with the official statistics and said, without elaborating, that the Police Department had changed the way it counts shootings in the city since Mr. Bratton took over as commissioner in 2014.  “I think there is some redefinition going on as to what amounts to a shooting,” Mr. Kelly said when asked about crime numbers, which are expected to register a 2 percent drop this year in major crime. “I think you have to take a hard look at those numbers.” Mr. Kelly, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, said he did not personally attack Mr. Bratton and meant only to raise an issue that had been brought to his attention by “several people” currently in the Police Department who were concerned. “I said nothing about him,” Mr. Kelly said. “It was a statement about the numbers being uncertain.”  According to the agency’s statistics, there were 1,125 shootings as of Sunday, down from 1,156 recorded over the same period the year before. The city has had a slight increase in murders, to 340 as of Sunday, but is still near the low of 333 recorded at the end of last year. Mr. Kelly added on Tuesday that the murder numbers were also suspect, suggesting that the category of “circumstances undetermined pending investigation” was being misapplied. Stephen Davis, the department’s spokesman, disputed each of the assertions that Mr. Kelly made on Tuesday. “He’s making claims that are not accurate or that, in many cases, are not any different from how they were measured in his administration,” Mr. Davis said. Mr. Bratton suggested that Mr. Kelly made his initial comments — in an interview with Gregory Floyd, the president of the local Teamsters union, set to air on WNYM-AM — to draw attention to his book, “Vigilance: My Life Serving America and Protecting Its Empire City.” It came out in September. “It’s amazing what comments you’ll make when selling a book,” Mr. Bratton said. “His comments were outrageous,” and, he added, “denigrate” the hard work of “police officers.” Though Mr. Bratton has criticized the skyrocketing number of recorded stop-and-frisk encounters during Mr. Kelly’s tenure, and Mr. Kelly had defended his policies, the two men had refrained from overtly challenging one another. But those who know them have long spoken of a simmering rivalry since the early 1990s, when Mr. Kelly was police commissioner and Mr. Bratton the chief of the Transit Police. In his book, Mr. Kelly barely mentions Mr. Bratton, who twice succeeded him as commissioner. In an interview in September, he called Mr. Bratton “a competent law enforcement professional.” Since returning to New York, Mr. Bratton has praised the work Mr. Kelly did after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to create a counterterrorism operation inside the Police Department to head off and respond to future attacks. His remarks on Tuesday came after a discussion of security preparations for New Year’s Eve, where roughly a million people are expected to watch the ball drop at midnight. Police commanders outlined a deployment that would include nearly 6,000 officers in and around Times Square, bomb sniffing dogs, metal detectors at 14 entry points, portable radiation detectors, plainclothes officers mixed in the crowd and other officers bearing semiautomatic rifles. “They are there in case anyone tries to breach the entry point,” Chief James R. Waters, the head of the department’s Counterterrorism Bureau since 2008, said of the heavily armed officers.  Mr. Bratton said that while the deployment on New Year’s Eve would be larger than last year’s by between 600 and 800 officers, there were no specific threats to the city. “We are not aware of any threat at this time that we deem credible,” he said. But the message of preparedness — “New York is ready,” Mr. de Blasio said — was quickly overshadowed by Mr. Bratton’s remarks about Mr. Kelly. When the reporter who asked Mr. Bratton about Mr. Kelly’s comments tried to ask a follow-up question, Mr. Bratton interjected: “You don’t need any follow-up; I just laid the challenge” to him. Mr. de Blasio, who stood silently by as Mr. Bratton spoke, was asked afterward what he made of the commissioner’s remarks. “I think the commissioner spoke eloquently,” the mayor said, before moving on to the next question.","Police Commissioner William J.

"LAS VEGAS — The Democratic presidential caucuses in Nevada were supposed to be an afterthought: lost in the shadows of high-profile battles in Iowa and New Hampshire, and fought in a state far off in the West where voters have a long, warm history with Bill and Hillary Clinton. Instead, after Mrs. Clinton’s overwhelming defeat in New Hampshire by Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday, eight days after she barely won the Iowa caucuses, Nevada is looming as a turning point in their increasingly competitive contest, offering critical tests of the two candidates’ strengths. After solid showings in two overwhelmingly white states, Mr. Sanders will have an opportunity to answer the central question for many Democrats trying to judge whether he is more than a particularly strong early-contest protest candidate. This state is as racially diverse as Iowa and New Hampshire are not: About 20 percent of the Democratic electorate is Hispanic, and 13 percent African-American. Over 95 percent of Vermont, his home state, is white. For Mrs. Clinton, Nevada offers a chance to put her campaign on solid footing after a staggering double-digit defeat in New Hampshire that stirred new concerns among Democrats about her political strengths. She opened her first office here last April, six months before Mr. Sanders. Her national campaign manager, Robby Mook, ran Nevada for Mrs. Clinton in 2008, when she narrowly won the popular vote, though in a quirk of Nevada caucus rules, lost the delegate vote. “A month ago, who would have thought this would be such a competitive race?” said Rebecca Lambe, the senior strategist for Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the minority leader. “Nevada will either be a potential firewall or a potential tiebreaker.” “It really is the first test there is of how effective you are going to be in mobilizing the Democratic coalition in a general election,” she said. Mr. Sanders’s senior adviser, Tad Devine, said Monday that campaign workers from Iowa, where Mr. Sanders nearly tied Mrs. Clinton, were being flown into Nevada to beef up a 90-person operation already in place. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers declined to disclose the size of their paid staff here. Mr. Sanders began advertising here in early December; Mrs. Clinton began in early January. “It has become more competitive,” Mr. Devine said. Nevada, he added, presents a “fair test” of Mr. Sanders’s potential national appeal. “Now we are moving into a different region in the country, a much more diverse group of voters.” The campaign unfurling here heading into the Feb. 20 caucuses could be instructive for reasons that go beyond Mr. Sanders’s ability to extend his demographic reach and the durability of Mrs. Clinton’s second bid for the presidency. Few states endured the degree of economic turmoil that racked Nevada during the recession. Vast tracts of housing developments were abandoned as the mortgage foreclosure crisis sent new homeowners fleeing, unemployment soared into the double digits and projects on the Las Vegas Strip were abandoned. The economy has turned around to a large extent. But memories of that brutal time endure and could create a political environment ripe for Mr. Sanders: His campaign has seized on the issues of income disparity and Wall Street abuses in the television advertisements airing here, which proved powerful in New Hampshire. “My street, oh my God, almost every house on that block of 20 houses was hit,” said Elizabeth Meinhold, 59, a Clark County high-school teacher who is supporting Mr. Sanders and said she believed Mrs. Clinton stood for “the establishment.” “We need real change and real movement in this country. Too much money is in the hands of a few,” she said, adding, “The last 40 years has been deregulation, tax cuts, Reaganism — it’s a disaster in my opinion.” Less attention has been paid so far by the Republican presidential candidates to their party’s Nevada caucuses, which take place three days after the Democrats’ contest. Instead, Republicans have been focusing on their South Carolina primary, which is on the same day as the Democratic caucuses here. Nevada is a relatively new battlefield for Democrats, but it will almost certainly be an important one in the general election. That there is little history to draw on, and that Nevada is a state of constantly shifting populations — people often come here seeking luck and opportunity, and leave if they find neither — means polling is scant and suspect. The caucuses were championed by Mr. Reid in 2008 to increase Nevada’s influence in the nominating process, and to bolster its economy with the influx of campaign workers and journalists that comes with a competitive contest. In an interview, Mr. Reid said he was heartened that the Iowa and New Hampshire outcomes had heightened Nevada’s importance, and argued that this was appropriate, given the state’s diversity and interests. “I am glad that we are not going to be overshadowed by what happens in New Hampshire and Iowa,” Mr. Reid said. “Why should a person’s ability to run for president be determined by New Hampshire and Iowa? They are not representative of America.” Mrs. Clinton has some noteworthy advantages. Her campaign is staffed by people steeped in Nevada politics, led by Mr. Mook, who is taking particular interest in the state. “We built this campaign, starting when she announced in April, to win a competitive primary,” Mr. Mook said. “That means not taking anything for granted. That means building a real presence. Nevada is an important part of that strategy.” And Bill Clinton is a popular figure here. “In Nevada, the one big guy in the room is Bill Clinton,” Mr. Reid said. “He comes all the time. He has very good friends there. He plays golf. So Bernie has a real problem there.” When Mr. Clinton campaigned for his wife here on a chilly evening before the first votes were cast in Iowa, people lined up for hours to see him. “Las Vegas has been good to us,” Mr. Clinton told the crowd. “Nevada has been good to us. You voted for me twice. We are very grateful.” Ron Nelsen, 60, the owner of a garage door company, said he had always supported the Clintons and planned to again on Feb. 20. “I like her vision of the country and health care and lifelong expertise in government,” he said. “Health care was my issue when Bill Clinton was elected the first time.” But, as in Iowa, Mr. Sanders has arrived with a boom that has discomfited the Clinton campaign, opening 11 offices in the state (compared with seven for Mrs. Clinton) and flooding television stations with advertisements. A recent debate-watching party was packed with supporters wearing red Sanders T-shirts. They cheered Mr. Sanders and hooted at Mrs. Clinton. When the lights came up during a commercial break, an organizer shouted: “Get on Twitter everybody! Tweet, tweet, tweet!” Nevada permits same-day voter registration, a matter of special concern to Mrs. Clinton since first-time caucusgoers flocked to Mr. Sanders in Iowa. And 30,000 Nevadans registered and voted on caucus day here in 2008, many of them brought in by Barack Obama. “In 2008, I worked in the Obama campaign and we saw a lot of young people involved,” said Joan Kato, Mr. Sanders’s Nevada state director, as college students sprawled on the floor of her campaign office, using cellphones to call voters. “We are seeing it again.” Emmy Ruiz, who is Mrs. Clinton’s state director, said the complexities involved in organizing for any caucus would pose a challenge for Mr. Sanders since he started late. “You cannot parachute in and run up the score in the caucus the same way you might be able to do in a primary,” she said. “This is what we have been preparing for.” Representative Dina Titus, Democrat of Nevada, said she was confident that Mrs. Clinton, whom she supports, would be able to overcome a surge of new voters. Nevada remains “Clinton country,” she said. Still, she said she was struck by the force of Mr. Sanders’s presence. “He’s making a race out of it,” she said. “He’s certainly going to get some votes.”","LAS VEGAS — The Democratic presidential caucuses in Nevada were supposed to be an afterthought: lost in the shadows of high-profile battles in Iowa and New Hampshire, and fought in a state far off in the West where voters have a long, warm history with Bill and Hillary Clinton.

"ARTEMIVSK, Ukraine — A fragile, European-brokered cease-fire deal for Ukraine appeared at risk of unraveling, at least in part, when a rebel leader announced Saturday night that he would not be bound by the accord on a central battlefield of the war. Although the Ukrainian president and the pro-Russian rebel leader both announced that the cease-fire had gone into effect, the separatist leader said it did not apply to Debaltseve, where thousands of Ukrainian troops have been under siege and might be surrounded. The rebel leader, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, said the town, a critical railway hub, had not been mentioned specifically in the cease-fire agreement. That deal, which went into effect at midnight, had been brokered by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the French president, François Hollande, in Minsk, Belarus. Neither leader immediately commented on Mr. Zakharchenko’s announcement about Debaltseve, which had been the scene of intense fighting in recent days as the rebels battled to take the town before any cease-fire. Just after the midnight deadline, Ukraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, went on national television saying he had ordered Ukraine’s armed forces to halt their fire in the contested eastern portion of the country. In his earlier statement, Mr. Zakharchenko, the head of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, also said he had ordered his forces to halt combat all along the front line in eastern Ukraine, as required in the Minsk agreement, but not near Debaltseve. He also indicated that rebel forces would not allow the approximately 8,000 Ukrainian troops who are there to leave.  “We will block all attempts to break out,” he said. “I have given the order.” The statement left a looming question about the future of the accord brokered Thursday with great effort by the European leaders, including 16 hours of overnight negotiations between Ms. Merkel, Mr. Hollande, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Poroshenko.  The cease-fire is the second such attempt to end a war that has claimed more than 5,400 lives since it began in April. Although Mr. Poroshenko said he had ordered the cease-fire, he added that Ukraine would not “turn the other cheek” if the other side violated the agreement, and he spoke bitterly of the two-and-a-half-day gap between the signing of the accord and the implementation of the cease-fire. “We were ready for an immediate cease-fire in Minsk,” he said. “But our counterparties asked for 60 hours. We paid a very heavy price for these 60 hours because dozens of Ukrainian citizens, including women and children, were killed.” Ukrainian forces also continued fighting until the cease-fire went into effect. Mr. Poroshenko urged the other leaders who had been involved in the talks to now ensure that the rest of the agreement was upheld. Within hours, reports emerged of possible cease-fire violations, including mortar fire near Debaltseve. But residents reached by phone in two cities with fighting on their outskirts, Donetsk and Mariupol, said all was calm.  From the cease-fire’s signing on Thursday until Saturday, the Ukrainian military reported 18 soldiers were killed and 63 wounded. At least four children were among the civilians who died in the recent fighting.  The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine issued a statement on Saturday evening carried by the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper saying Mr. Zakharchenko’s comments signaled that, “In this way, the Donetsk People’s Republic announces it does not recognize the Minsk accord and will continue military action.” Mr. Poroshenko said Saturday he would ask the Ukrainian Parliament to declare a national state of martial law if the cease-fire broke down. Russian-backed militants and Mr. Putin have insisted that Debaltseve is surrounded; the Ukrainian government has not conceded that point. The only Ukrainian resupply road into the town is peppered with mines and in the range of artillery by both sides, and it is unclear who is in control.  Even before Mr. Zakharchenko announced the accord did not apply to Debaltseve, anger had been swelling among Ukrainian soldiers at a negotiated lag between the signing of the agreement and its implementation.  Fighting raged through the day on Saturday. Both sides had tried to land final blows before midnight. Shells killed two people in the rebel-held city of Donetsk. Soldiers interviewed at their sandbagged positions along the contested road, as well as ambulance crews and doctors, expressed rising anger over the agreement that led not to a hoped-for calm, but an escalation in fighting. The poorly guarded, 31-mile supply road into Debaltseve on Saturday was shrouded in an eerie mist and rimmed by bare trees, their limbs prickly with glistening hoarfrost. Through the day, ambulances rushed to a hospital carrying from the fight the wounded whose luck ran out hours before the accord was intended to take effect. “The cease-fire was a political decision by my government,” Oksana D. Yarosh, a Ukrainian military surgeon, said in an interview outside the Artemivsk Central Regional hospital, where the most gravely injured are evaluated. She could not judge the decision to leave open the window for a final frenzy of fighting, she said, because it was unclear what other options existed. “I am a military doctor,” she said. “I serve, and my service is trying to save lives and health. Personally, it has been very painful for me to see the boys with shrapnel wounds.” One of her patients, a 32-year-old soldier, came in Thursday night with severe shrapnel wounds to his face, and his right elbow had been so severely wounded that his arm would probably have to be amputated below the joint, though she refrained from doing so immediately. “His life will never be the same,” Dr. Yarosh said. “I think, ‘How horrible is war.’ And I think, ‘How scary that we lose people in this way.’ It’s been difficult.” The United States on Friday said that Russian artillery was aiding the separatists in the battle to encircle the town, site of a strategic railroad switching yard. On Saturday, the American ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt, posted satellite images on his Twitter account to bolster the case that Russia had joined the separatists. One image seemed to show four gun lines of towed artillery and one of self-propelled artillery northeast of Debaltseve, in a landscape in snowy towns of gray. Another showed what Mr. Pyatt said were air-defense systems, and the third showed the black, streaky exhaust plumes of what was labeled a “Russian multiple rocket launcher deployment” near Shakhtar, Ukraine. A medic reached on Saturday by cellphone in Debaltseve, Albert Sardaryen, a 22-year-old who left his university to volunteer with an ambulance crew, said the city had been attacked by Grad rockets through the night Friday, but that the firing let up around 11 a.m. on Saturday. Soldiers were hunkered down in basements or bunkers, he said. The scale of the casualties was unclear, he said, because many of the wounded could not be taken from their front-line positions to his field hospital.  The last ambulance left Debaltseve on Thursday evening, before the escalation that followed the cease-fire signing. “The situation is quite difficult,” Mr. Sardaryen said. “We don’t believe in the cease-fire. We are a little bit worried of being trapped. If there is no way out, all we can do is stay and fight here.”","ARTEMIVSK, Ukraine — A fragile, European-brokered cease-fire deal for Ukraine appeared at risk of unraveling, at least in part, when a rebel leader announced Saturday night that he would not be bound by the accord on a central battlefield of the war.

"HOUSTON — Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters have left this sprawling metropolis partially ruined and eager to return to something like normalcy. But the storm has also forced many thousands of people out of their homes. As a result, the city is engaged in one giant collective improvisation. Its defining creative endeavor is where to find a place to sleep. Greater Houston is big enough, with enough dry and intact neighborhoods, to absorb many of the people whose own homes are now moldy and wrecked. But absorption is not always easy. The cleanup will take years, and many Houston residents are heading into autumn under unfamiliar roofs. They will be packing school lunches over hotel minibars, and packing themselves into the guest rooms of neighbors and relatives and friends. Some remain stranded in shelters, and others have returned, in desperation, to the stench of unrepaired homes. Here are the stories of five of those people, unmoored from the homes they knew, adrift in a city they know well. Ricky Gentle burns incense at night, vanilla or lavender, to hide the smell of his moldy apartment. He knows this is no place to stay, that it cannot be healthy to breathe in here, but he and his brother and his brother’s wife have no other place to go. The one night they spent in a shelter — “people half-crazy going around” — seemed even more dangerous. The night the flood came, Mr. Gentle, 54, lay in bed and heard the pots and pans clanging in the kitchen cabinets, a signal that waters were rising fast in the apartment. He and his brother helped float the elderly and sick out of the flooding one-story apartment complex on mattresses, breaking into a nearby church for immediate shelter. They came back to the apartment the next day, finding the complex empty but the water mostly gone, other than the raw sewage still sitting in his bathtub. They spent days scrubbing the walls. “We got to breathe in that stuff and it ain’t no good. But ain’t nothing we can do,” he said. This is home but an unfamiliar one. Most of the furniture is gone. So are all of his clothes but four T-shirts, three pairs of socks, three pairs of pants and some boxers. They do have a portrait of the brothers’ parents hanging in the empty living room. And the nights here are quiet. “We just sit here and let the days pass by,” Mr. Gentle said. Marcella Gonzales’s husband went back to work at his warehouse job a few days ago, but they still have nowhere to live, and so Ms. Gonzales spends her days waiting for him at the cavernous George R. Brown Convention Center downtown. Sometimes she waits in front of the big flat screen television with the other Houstonians who have nowhere to go. More than 10,000 people crowded into the convention center shelter at the height of the crisis. By Friday, there were around 1,200 left. Some were chronically homeless men who had nowhere to go before Hurricane Harvey. Ms. Gonzales sits among them, uncomplaining and generally upbeat, never without her smartphone and the stylish cream-colored leather handbag she bought from Dillard’s department store. Ms. Gonzales, 43, and her husband fled their rental home, along with her two teenage daughters and their 2-year-old grandson, Adam, when the roof caved and the floodwaters reached her knees. The kids went with Ms. Gonzales’s mom, but her mom is recovering from a heart attack and Ms. Gonzales worries about how she is dealing with the stress. On Thursday night she picked up Adam and took him back to the shelter. The toddler slept between his grandparents on a pair of cots they had pushed together in the big open hall, amid a sea of cots and sleeping strangers. Her husband’s truck gave out Thursday, probably from taking on floodwater. Ms. Gonzales went to see a lady from the Federal Emergency Management Agency about a next place to live, but she was confused by the requirements, and gave up. By Friday morning, she said she had no real plan. The night before, her husband had come back to the shelter and conked out after dealing with work and the dead truck. There was no time to talk about the future. “I kind of feel a little worried about a lot of things right now,” she said. “I try not to let it get to me. But I do pray about it.” Jolin Matthews sat in her bedroom, which for today was Clara Grant’s living room, and tried to account for the past two weeks. It began at Ms. Matthews’ apartment on a Saturday night, with a group watching the McGregor-Mayweather fight. The rain was falling and water was seeping in the door, but it was not until the next morning that the flooding turned serious. Now it gets hazier. That first night Ms Matthews spent with a number of other displaced people at the house of one of her daughters. It was loud and crowded, and so she went — Ms Matthews, 48, thought for a moment. Ashley’s house? Ms Grant, 56, offered, referring to a friend of Ms. Matthews, who is also Ms. Grant’s niece. No, Ms. Matthews said, thinking. Ashley was later. Anyway, it was on the second or third day that she had heard from Ms. Grant, a friend from work. Ms. Grant offered her couch, and despite reservations about being a burden, Ms Matthews hitched a ride to Ms Grant’s quiet bungalow, where she spent a peaceful night. But only one night. Then it was back to her daughter’s crowded house. Or maybe that was the night at Ashley’s. Or someone else’s. Or was that the night that she spent sleeping in a car by her flooded-out apartment? A night here, a night there, transportation from anyone whose car still worked. All of it was exhausting. And it was just beginning. Who knew how long she would stay this time at Ms Grant’s or where she would go next? Who knew when she would get disaster assistance? Still, she was grateful. “If I didn’t have friends and family like this,” she said, putting her arm around Ms. Grant, “I don’t know where I’d be.” Sylvia Garcia lies awake at night on her foldout bed and thinks of home. Ever since the flood, she and her parents and her younger sister have slept in a room in an uncle’s house, just southeast of Houston. The family is all together, and safe. They bought a folding table and brought in lawn chairs to make for a cheerful dining room. Another uncle, who had been with Ms Garcia’s family on the night of the flood, is also now staying at the house. Ms. Garcia’s niece and nephew will be coming next weekend. The family wears donated clothes, Ms. Garcia, 25, does online schoolwork when she gets out of her day job and the men watch football. But she thinks constantly of her house, eight miles away, now half-gutted, its contents disgorged into the front lawn. She had been making payments on that house herself so there would be some stability for her parents, who are in bad health. “To make them happy,” she said. She bought much of the furniture and even managed to scrape up enough money to buy a used van for her mother. The last night she spent in the house was on a tabletop, surrounded by rising waters, huddled with her mother, younger sister and uncle. Her father, who had been discharged from a hospital as the rains came, had arrived home just as the floods did. He passed the night floating in the water on a chair nearby, still groggy from medicine. The night passed dark and terrifying, and at first light she saw outside the window that boats were passing by on her street. The furniture is all ruined; the van was sold as scrap for $200. She thinks about all of this at night, but she knows she’s not the only one in the room lying awake. “They also can’t sleep at night,” Ms. Garcia said of her parents. “They’re wondering, ‘Are we going to have a house to go back to?’” Kimberly Gatlin lives 10 minutes away from her half-ruined dream home. She stays at a Holiday Inn Express now, along Interstate 45. The recovery workers come down for breakfast in their work clothes around 6 a.m. Ms. Gatlin’s room is tidy, just like the dream home used to be. She has arranged a little bar, with big bottles of vodka and Hennessy cognac and Grand Marnier. She has a grocery bag stuffed with cans of tuna fish and pineapple. Ms. Gatlin’s neighborhood is called Westador, 20 minutes north of downtown. She bought her house in 2010, and she fell in love with all of it. The house has five bedrooms and fancy ironwork on the balcony, like something out of an old movie. Ms. Gatlin, 52, is black, and the neighborhood has grown increasingly multicultural in recent years, but neighborliness, she said, trumps race: once a month, everyone on her block goes out for a friendly dinner. Today, her section of the neighborhood still manages to exude a kind of refined charm, even though everyone’s stuff is now chucked out and growing mold by the curb in big piles. It’s as though a formation of handsome men, all in smart suits, drank too much cognac and emptied the contents of their stomachs all at once. It smells that way, too. Ms. Gatlin is a train dispatcher for the railroad, and her company is paying for her hotel stay. They need her at work. “If a train dispatcher is not in the chair, no trains move,” she said. She has started back at the job now, but before that she was out at the dream home every day, coordinating the volunteers who ripped out her drywall and the guy who towed away her dead cars. “I’m physically, mentally and emotionally tired – I’m exhausted,” she said. “But you’ve got to keep going.” She has no idea when she will be back home in Westador. On Friday morning, she said she was thinking about buying a rug for the hotel bathroom, and maybe a spread to personalize the bed.",HOUSTON — Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters have left this sprawling metropolis partially ruined and eager to return to something like normalcy.

"GLEN ELLEN, Calif. — Hundreds of sleep-deprived, stubble-faced firefighters, their yellow coats layered with soot, assembled here Wednesday to hear their commanders say what they already knew: The fires that have devastated California’s wine country were still spreading, nowhere near containment, and the crews battling the blazes were stretched to their limits. “I wish I could say the cavalry is coming — it’s not,” Battalion Chief Kirk Van Wormer of Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, told the gathering of firefighters, flecks of ash raining down on them. “Look to your left and look to your right. Those are the people you are responsible for right now.” Fanned by warm, dry winds, the fires have grown so big, so fast, that the immediate goal fire officials set was not so much to stop the spread as to slow it, to channel it away from threatened cities and towns, and to save lives. Saving homes and businesses was secondary. The fires have killed at least 29 people in Northern California, officials said on Thursday. Fifteen of the deaths were in Sonoma County. Officials cautioned that the figures could rise as emergency workers are able to return to scorched areas and search for hundreds of people who have been reported missing. Robert Giordano, the Sonoma County sheriff, said, “So far, in the recoveries, we have found bodies that were almost completely intact, and we have found bodies that were nothing more than ash and bones.” In some cases, he said, the only way to identify the victims was by the serial numbers stamped on artificial joints and other medical devices that were in their bodies. Statewide, there were 21 major fires burning on Thursday, having consumed more than 191,000 acres since the outbreak began on Sunday night, said Ken Pimlott, the chief of Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency. The number of separate fires rises and falls often, as new blazes flare up and old ones merge with one another, but the size of the devastated area has grown steadily. In the hardest-hit region, in Napa and Sonoma Counties, the sun was an orange dot in a leaden haze. There were eight major blazes there on Thursday, and the burned area grew to more than 120,000 acres, Cal Fire reported. The agency said that the 34,000-acre Tubbs Fire, which has burned parts of the city of Santa Rosa and has threatened Geyserville, was 10 percent contained, but most of the other blazes in wine country were 3 percent contained or less. Officials threw out sobering figures on the scale of the devastation, with the caveat that the numbers were just estimates, sure to rise when the crisis has abated enough to allow an accurate damage assessment. Thousands of structures have been destroyed, many more are threatened, and tens of thousands of people have been displaced. “These fires are literally just burning faster than firefighters can run,” Mr. Pimlott said. Wind-whipped embers leapfrogged past the exhausted fire crews, he said, so “we are attacking many, many new fires that we put out while they are still small.” Almost 8,000 state and local firefighters battled the blazes, using more than 550 fire engines, 73 helicopters and more than 30 airplanes, state officials said, with additional crews and 320 more fire engines en route from neighboring states and from federal agencies. But vast as the resources were, they clearly were not enough. The standard practice in a California wildfire is for firefighters to work 24-hour shifts, and then have 24 hours off. But many firefighters in Sonoma and Napa have had no real rests for days, catching a few hours of sleep on the ground or in their trucks. “We’ve got guys who have been working 80 hours straight,” said Capt. Sean Norman, the deputy head of operations for the Sonoma Valley fires. “You’ve got to have a fifth gear. You’ve got to have the two C’s: Commitment and caffeine.” Giving units their assignments, he instructed them how to call in air tankers to drop water or fire retardant, and implored them to stay safe. “We don’t have the resources to anchor and defend,” Captain Norman told them. With wind gusting from the north, fire crews primarily formed lines along the southern flanks of the fires, often carrying heavy gear through rugged terrain, trying to slow or stop the spread. They doused the flames and threatened vegetation with hoses, and firefighters and National Guard troops used bulldozers, shovels and axes to clear brush and trees, to create fire breaks. With a major wildfire fanned by high winds, firefighters can often do little more than focus on saving lives, experts said. That can include performing a kind of triage, deciding which structures to save and which to let burn. “The biggest part of the playbook is that you focus on public safety and not fighting the fire,” said J. Keith Gilless, dean of the College of Natural Resources at the University of California, Berkeley. “Your capacity on really extreme fire behavior — and this was really extreme fire behavior — is really quite limited. This is about as complex a situation as you are going to find.” The wind defeats the usual strategy, to create a perimeter — a path around the fire that has been stripped of fuel — and then close in on the flames from there. If a fire is described as 10 percent contained, that means that 10 percent of the perimeter has been established. In Napa, the largest of the fires is described as only 3 percent contained. “You have to just wait for Mother Nature to take a rest before you can flank the fire and put a perimeter around it,” said Bob Roper, a consultant and former fire chief in Ventura County, Calif. He added that ordinarily, fire commanders can call on resources from around the state to fight a major blaze, but having so many places in flames at once limits their ability to do that. In Bennett Valley near Santa Rosa, a ranch owner had left the sprinklers on before fleeing, and even as a fire engulfed a nearby mountain and spread toward the ranch, black and white cows grazed in an untouched pasture nearby. A few firefighters doused the property perimeter, but within minutes, small, new patches of flame flared up; it had been like that for days, hindering progress, and making it impossible to defend each structure. “The biggest thing is the sheer volume of fire we have,” said Kevin Burris, acting captain of the Petaluma Fire Department, who said the fires were the worst he had seen in 15 years on the job. Soot covered his face, and he said he had slept just five hours in the previous four days. Mr. Van Wormer, the Cal Fire battalion chief, said optimal staffing for a fire of 20,000 acres is 1,000 firefighters. In Sonoma Valley, where more acreage than that has burned, he said there were 464 firefighters, including about 60 state prison inmates. “We are not giving people rest,” he said. “Exhaustion is a huge problem.” With no reports of lightning strikes in recent days, fire officials said their investigations are likely to conclude that human activity caused the fires. One possibility they are investigating is that power lines or other parts of the electrical grid ignited vegetation; a number of lines in the region went down, but it is not clear whether that happened before or during the burning. In April, California’s Public Utilities Commission fined the Pacific Gas and Electric Company $8.3 million for failing to properly clear vegetation around a power line in the Sierra Nevada, sparking a fire in 2015 that burned more than 70,000 acres, killed two people, and destroyed 550 homes. The state has been trying to force the company to pay $90 million in firefighting costs.","GLEN ELLEN, Calif. — Hundreds of sleep-deprived, stubble-faced firefighters, their yellow coats layered with soot, assembled here Wednesday to hear their commanders say what they already knew: The fires that have devastated California’s wine country were still spreading, nowhere near containment, and the crews battling the blazes were stretched to their limits. “I wish I could say the cavalry is coming — it’s not,” Battalion Chief Kirk Van Wormer of Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, told the gathering of firefighters, flecks of ash raining down on them.","GLEN ELLEN, Calif. — Hundreds of sleep-deprived, stubble-faced firefighters, their yellow coats layered with soot, assembled here Wednesday to hear their commanders say what they already knew: The fires that have devastated California’s wine country were still spreading, nowhere near containment, and the crews battling the blazes were stretched to their limits. “I wish I could say the cavalry is coming — it’s not,” Battalion Chief Kirk Van Wormer of Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, told the gathering of firefighters, flecks of ash raining down on them. Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s pick for defense secretary. It also explains Gen. John F. Kelly, who was homeland security secretary until he left in July to serve as the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly — who has urged the president to have tweets vetted by his aides — Mr. Trump was still determined not to censor himself on social media and was fully capable of roiling the diplomatic waters with a single unguarded post. At 6:42 a.m., Mr. Trump tweeted that he hoped Democrats “do not force Nancy P out.” To many Democrats, Ms. Pelosi is their own indispensable woman, a legislative genius, tactical wizard and prolific fund-raiser whose ability to hold together a fractious caucus is written in her own success in passing many laws, and blocking even more. But some in her caucus have reached a different conclusion: She is not, well, worth it. Representative Kathleen Rice, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, could face legal action for having said that Mr. Trump’s campaign-trail pledge that fundamentally overhauling the Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s announcement yesterday that the United States now formally recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said it planned to do so twice more this year. Only three of the 17 officials who submitted forecasts expect the central bank to move too quickly, before there is clear evidence of a threat from a small but potentially dangerous group of residents of their own countries. American intelligence agencies have determined that the Russian government tried to sway the election in his favor. Nevertheless, the meeting was confirmed by the White House only on Tuesday, after reports surfaced that some of the guests had been surprised that it occurred. The dinner discussion caught the attention of other leaders around the table, some of whom later remarked privately on the odd spectacle of an American president seeming to single out the Russian leader for special attention at a summit meeting that included some of the United States’largest hospitals are nervously watching the gathering legislative, economic and geopolitical storm. The executives say this concern on trade is based on simple math. In Chicago Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s announcement on Thursday that state-sponsored hackers — the company did not say what country it believes they are working for — had made off with more than 500 million customers’personal records was stunning to many, intelligence officials say it can be seen as just the latest step in an escalating nation-state digital warfare campaign. “A lot of the things that happened that everybody is very angry about, I can tell you: It would have been out long ago. And if anybody watched Peter Strzok testify over the last couple of decades, especially in the last few weeks, feed a long bull market. For investors around the world, that sense of anxious waiting is only going to build after Friday’s report is unlikely to persuade officials to deviate from their gradual and carefully devised march to higher interest rates. The central bank is on track to raise rates twice more this year, after two increases in the first half of October than in previous months,” the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s son, he resisted uttering any words of contrition until an unusual statement on Sunday morning. While Mr. Bannon edited and approved the version that ultimately became public, an associate sent out the statement without his knowledge, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. By early afternoon, snow was falling fast and furiously around Boston, where 12 inches was expected. While that was some 6 inches below what had been forecast, Gov. Charlie Baker repeated warnings for commuters to stay home. “This is one of the most consequential analyses by American spy agencies in years. Mr. Trump has risen quickly to the top of several polls, challenging or erasing the long-held leads of Mr. Walker in Iowa and Mr. Bush in New Hampshire, and he enters the debates with far greater name recognition and personal wealth to draw on than the other candidates, who cannot afford to pay. In Alabama, the state budget for prosecutors has declined precipitously, and is now roughly half of what it was in 2008. District Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, had expressed hope that his success at building alliances with leaders from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations in recent months had put that perception behind them, according to White House documents. In 1999, Mr. Trump proposed a “net worth tax” on the wealthy to pay off the national debt. “Personally this plan would cost me hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of establishment candidates such as Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio to be especially tense. And watch for how Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, also rejected that path. The collapse highlighted a harsh reality for Senate Republicans: While they freely assailed the health law when Mr. Obama occupied the White House, they listen to him in a totally different way, ‘ Were you involved in the meddling with the election?’” he recalled. “This was my first time being robbed.” So he offered $5 to the robber, who took it and thanked her. would often Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s repeated assertion this week that the news media has cherry-picked information to make the president look bad,” Mr. Guerra said in a later phone interview, reflecting on Mr. Sessions’s long record as a zealous prosecutor and his well-known views on the dangers of drug use, his push to undo Obama-era sentencing policies and ramp up the war on drugs was hardly a surprise. In his Facebook post, which had elicited more than 16,000 reactions as of late Saturday, Chief Acevedo said he had received “countless calls and letters” from family members asking him to discuss the issue, he was sick and unable to say Sunday Mass. The auxiliary bishop, Gregorio Rosa Chávez, indicated that there would be a raucous Republican primary in a turbulent red state. Had Mr. Trump named a non-senator to the job, no such election would have taken place. Sessions removed himself in March, he was facing blistering criticism over previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Mr. Trump’s success Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s announcement on Tuesday was yet another major stumble in the unsteady quest by Republican congressional leaders to deliver a repeal bill to the desk of Mr. Trump, who see the review as a political effort to impugn the legitimacy of his election victory. By suggesting — as he has before — that the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency’s surveillance dragnet, temporarily forcing a lapse in the law that gives the government wide discretion in collecting Americans’phone-call data, Mr. Paul is publicly embracing the libertarian-hued philosophy that is synonymous with his family name. “Often we use fear, and we say, ‘ Gosh, we don’t want them talking too much about it.’” Whether that proves to be a political victory for Mr. Trump and Republicans who have tried to diminish the flag’s prominence. In the days since the Israeli election, Mr. Netanyahu has been here before."
"Donald J. Trump left little doubt on Monday that he intends to run on the same proposals on immigration and terrorism that animated his primary campaign, using his first speech after the massacre in Orlando, Fla., to propose sweeping measures against Muslims that pay little heed to American traditions of pluralism. Without distinguishing between mainstream Muslims and Islamist terrorists, Mr. Trump suggested that all Muslim immigrants posed potential threats to America’s security and called for a ban on migrants from any part of the world with “a proven history of terrorism” against the United States or its allies. He also insinuated that American Muslims were all but complicit in acts of domestic terrorism for failing to report attacks in advance, asserting without evidence that they had warnings of shootings like the one in Orlando. Mr. Trump’s speech, delivered at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., represented an extraordinary break from the longstanding rhetorical norms of American presidential nominees. But if his language more closely resembled a European nationalist’s than a mainstream Republican’s, he was wagering that voters are stirred more by their fears of Islamic terrorism than any concerns they may have about his flouting traditions of tolerance and respect for religious diversity. Mr. Trump, who drew criticism last fall, including a sharp rebuke from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for first suggesting a constitutionally questionable ban on Muslim immigration, on Monday described Islamic extremism as a pervasive global menace that was penetrating the United States through unchecked immigration. Citing the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 by two men with ties to Chechnya and instances of radicalization in Minnesota’s Somali immigrant community, Mr. Trump painted a bleak portrait of the country as under siege from within and abroad. “They’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the Islamic State. “And we don’t know what’s happening.” He accused American Muslims of failing to “turn in the people who they know are bad,” effectively blaming other Muslims for the shooting in Orlando and the attack last year in San Bernardino, Calif., that was carried out by a married couple inspired by the Islamic State. “They didn’t turn them in,” Mr. Trump said, “and we had death and destruction.” Mr. Trump carefully read his remarks from a teleprompter and offered more detail than his stump speeches generally contain, but his speech was still rife with the sort of misstatements and exaggerations that have typified his campaign. He repeatedly stretched the facts, for example, in describing the United States as overrun by dangerous migrants. He claimed the country has an “immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country,” brushing aside the entire customs and immigration enforcement infrastructure. And he asserted that there was a “tremendous flow” of Syrian refugees, when just 2,805 of them were admitted into the country from October to May, fewer than one-third of the 10,000 Syrians President Obama said the United States would accept this fiscal year. Mr. Trump described the gunman in the Orlando shooting as “an Afghan,” though he was born an American citizen in New York City to parents who had emigrated from Afghanistan to the United States over three decades ago. Mr. Trump assailed the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, accusing her of favoring immigration policies that would invite a flood of potential jihadists to the United States, which he warned could be “a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was.” Mrs. Clinton, speaking in Cleveland earlier in the day, argued that engaging in “inflammatory, anti-Muslim rhetoric” made the country less safe. Delivering the sort of conventional speech that most presidential contenders would offer in the wake of tragedy, she did not mention Mr. Trump. But, while saying the “murder of innocent people breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security and makes us furious,” she described proposals to ban Muslim immigration as offensive and counterproductive. “America is strongest when we all believe we have a stake in our country and our future,” she said, calling to mind the bipartisan spirit that took hold after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when she was a senator from New York. Mrs. Clinton has sought to present herself as the default choice of mainstream voters, including Republicans disturbed by Mr. Trump, and on Monday she stressed the importance of building relationships between law enforcement agencies and American Muslims. “Our open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability,” Mrs. Clinton said. As Mrs. Clinton reached for the mantle of statesmanship, Mr. Trump’s speech amounted to a rejection of the conventional wisdom that he must remake himself for the November election as a more sober figure and discard the volcanic tone and ethnic and racial provocation that marked his primary campaign. Yet Mr. Trump has showed little interest in assuaging those concerns. He used the hours after the Orlando massacre to claim prescience about the attack and to demand Mr. Obama’s resignation. Then, in a television interview on Monday morning, Mr. Trump darkly suggested that the president was sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. “We’re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he’s got something else in mind,” Mr. Trump said. “There is something going on.” Some Republicans said Mr. Trump’s determination to play to his hard-line base was undermining his standing as a general election candidate. “He has to do what Reagan had to do. Reagan eventually had to make a sale that he was not a risk,” said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman, recalling the 1980 election. “There is time, but the way he’s going about it now doesn’t do it at all. It keeps him in the hunt, but it doesn’t get him elected.” John F. Lehman, a former Navy secretary and an adviser to John McCain’s and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns, said he anticipated that Mr. Trump’s standing would improve after the Orlando attack. But he said Mr. Trump’s Muslim ban went “too far” and questioned whether he had made any effort to learn about national security. Mr. Trump’s remarks may come as an acute disappointment to Republican leaders in Washington who have spent the days since he claimed the party’s nomination pleading with him to button down his campaign, only to see him intensify its racial tenor. It is enough to convince senior Republicans that talk of an eventual pivot is folly — that he is unwilling or incapable of being reined in. “Everybody says, ‘Look, he’s so civilized, he eats with a knife and fork,’” said Mike Murphy, a former top adviser to Jeb Bush. “And then an hour later, he takes the fork and stabs somebody in the eye with it.” An earlier version of this article misquoted Hillary Clinton during her speech in Cleveland on Monday. She called for vigilance in the fight against homegrown terrorists inspired by the Islamic State and said the response to the Orlando massacre required “clear eyes, steady hands, and unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values.” She did not say the response required “unwary determination.”","Donald J.

Even a limited strike — on, say, a North Korean missile on its launching pad or a missile in midair — would pose risks that the North’s capabilities, rather than eliminate them, has shades of the Iran deal that Mr. Trump just signed into law, a comment that angered others in the White House about the situation, Mr. McGahn privately erupted at Mr. Cobb, according to people informed about the confrontation who asked not to be named describing the president’s decision to share the videos. Yet with Britain scheduled to quit the European Union in 2019, Mrs. May is hoping to strike an early trade deal with Washington to compensate for a probable reduction in British access to markets in continental Europe. The position Mrs. May finds herself in with Mr. Trump, while conservatives are talking up Mr. Jordan as a candidate to succeed Representative Paul D. Ryan as speaker. Neither lawmaker responded on Wednesday to requests for comment.

It includes both moderate and extremist Islamists. Libyans fearful of the extremists have embraced him as a hero, while others have denounced him as a second Qaddafi. The western city of Zintan has allied with him mainly in shared opposition to the expanding influence of the coastal city of Misurata. Officials of that coalition’s provisional government, based in Tripoli, say they oppose the Islamic State. Jamal Naji Zubia, head of the Tripoli foreign media office, recently suggested that the Benghazi Islamist fighters should address the problem by better explaining themselves through the news media. “I don’t think that’s what voters will want in the end.” But Mrs. Clinton’s gentle reproach about partisanship of late is meant to reassure independent voters that she would be a forceful and steady commander in chief, noting her role in the killing of Osama bin Laden in a speech from Leaders from around the globe began adding their signatures to a treaty that bans mining in Antarctica. It is expected to come up for review in 2048 — or in the event that it is ripped up before, Chinese and Australian experts say. “So far, Democrats are gumming up the works,” said John Walter, a cousin of Donald Trump who is the family historian. But in the 1960s, the Trumps gravitated to Marble. The lure was Dr. Peale, a household name since the publication of the 1952 best seller that transformed “the power of positive thinking” into a national catchphrase. Today he is remembered for preaching optimism and personal fulfillment, asserting that it was possible to delay testing, and that in their experience the same-day rule was not as strictly enforced as the manual suggests. Once they have started working, federal employees are supposed to grow only basil and oregano in their gardens, while their neighbors in Washington are allowed to cultivate marijuana.

Among the nominees leaving with nothing: “Lion,” an adoption tear-jerker with six nominations, and the box office hit “Hidden Figures,” which had three nods. As expected, Ms. Davis won the best supporting actress Oscar — her first — for playing a world-weary housewife in “Fences.” (She won best actress at the 2010 Tony Awards for playing the same role onstage. She was the one who summoned the ambulance, saying she had found him lying on the floor bleeding. Just before his putative assassination, Mr. Babchenko posted a comment on his Facebook page about how he escaped death four years ago when a general barred him from an overloaded helicopter that ended up crashing, killing all 14 people on board. The post prompted an outpouring of comments that this time, he had not been so lucky. Even a limited strike — on, say, a North Korean missile on the launchpad in a pre-emptive strike, a faction of Islamists and regional militias seized the capital, Tripoli. It includes both moderate and extremist Islamists as well as ethnic Berbers and the powerful militia from the coastal city of Misurata. The other coalition, centered in Misurata, controls the capital, Tripoli. Libya swiftly collapsed into an armed conflict between two rival coalitions of cities and tribes. The internationally recognized government is based in Saudi Arabia and in the south of Yemen. For a recent 10-day trip to Sana and surrounding areas, a photographer and I had to obtain visas from the Houthis. We could not book flights into Sana because the Saudi-led coalition had halted all commercial air traffic. The United Nations allowed us onto an aid flight. As soon as we touched down, we saw traces of the war: the scattered carcasses of destroyed airplanes along the runway. Once in Yemen, we were told that we could not go anywhere without a representative of the Houthis. He was Leaders from around the globe began adding their signatures to a treaty that bans mining in Antarctica. It is expected to increase prices — the tax is about 30 cents for a 20-ounce drink, or $2.16 for a 12-pack. If passed on to consumers, the increase is expected to substantially reduce sales of sweetened drinks. The city finance department estimates it will raise $91 million a year. Sugary drinks have been linked to health problems, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. But there’s trouble in the muck this growing season. The first sign of the storm approaching Akademgorodok came early in 2016, when Mr. Trubitsyn and his colleagues began hearing that their competitors were telling hospitals that Tion’s air purifiers were dangerous and were being investigated by Roszdravnadzor, a state agency that enforces the lobbying law, and a formal complaint filed with the city’s police sergeants, said, “The justice system shows no one is above the law.” Mr. Trump promised fixes to the immigration system that conservative, anti-immigrant activists have long sought. The case at the Supreme Court was of leftward movement. “This term feels just huge,” said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter who has argued more than 30 cases in the Supreme Court and studied its work for two decades. “Before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, adding: “Cabdrivers will be dropping people off there.” For many, the closing is a nonissue, including those who rely on the subway system or believe New York is still too car-oriented. Many neighbors are happy to see the station, which they see as an eyesore, go, including members of Community Board 2, which approved the new building. Board members did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the spokesman for the Cincinnati-based company, Andrew D. Ciafardini."
"DAVOS, Switzerland — By any measure, he made a lot of money, the kid from Queens, maybe not as much as he boasted, but a fortune. And yet never accepted, never respected, he remained on the outside pressing his nose against the window of the club of elites he both revered and resented. So when President Trump arrives in this snowy, mountaintop resort where financial titans mingle with heads of state in an annual saturnalia of capitalism, it may feel like a moment of vindication. Never invited when he was merely a businessman, Mr. Trump will arrive on Thursday as leader of the world’s last superpower, commanding attention if not admiration. Whatever else, he cannot be ignored now. “Part of him will feel the resentment that has long smoldered within and part will revel in the fact that he’s the president and no one else is,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer. “Considering his tendency to say or tweet whatever comes to mind, we might expect both Trumps — the testy one and the triumphant one — to appear. We may even see and hear him toggle between the two, uncertain if he’s superior or inferior.” Mr. Trump’s decision to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, something American presidents generally avoid lest they look out of touch hanging out with the jet-setting crowd, sets the stage for one of the most intriguing encounters of his year-old presidency. Not only will he finally crash the party that would not have him, but he will also bring his protectionist, “America First” message to the ground zero of globalization, addressing the very people he has cast as the villains of his political narrative. The president foreshadowed the awkward and perhaps tense visit by slapping tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines just before departing Washington. “I’m going to Davos,” Mr. Trump said after signing the orders. “We’ll be talking about investing in the United States again, for people to come in and spend their money in the good old U.S.A.” Rather than touting the virtues of lowering economic barriers, Mr. Trump will promote the growing American economy and argue for foreign investment. “The president will continue to promote fair economic competition and will make it clear that there cannot be free and open trade if countries are not held accountable to the rules,” said Gary D. Cohn, his economics adviser. “As the president has said repeatedly, America and his administration supports free and open trade, but it needs to be fair and reciprocal.” His message will stand out. In the forum’s opening address on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India defended globalization. Later in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada announced that his country and 10 other Pacific Rim nations had concluded talks for a trade pact without the United States. Scheduled to depart from Washington on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump will stay in Davos just one night and meet with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, with whom he had testy exchanges over his posting of anti-Muslim videos distributed by a far-right British group, as well as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, with whom he is friendlier. He will also attend a reception of world leaders in his honor and host a dinner for European corporate chieftains. Seven cabinet secretaries, including Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to attend. Among those who will not come is Melania Trump, who has kept a low profile since a new book reported that she was so wary of life in the White House that she cried on election night and The Wall Street Journal reported that her husband’s lawyer sent $130,000 to a porn actress before the election to keep her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mrs. Trump denied the book’s account and has otherwise largely remained silent. Her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said on Tuesday that the first lady was not coming to Davos because there were “too many scheduling and logistical issues.” How Mr. Trump will calibrate his message is the preoccupation of the forum so far. Will he declare victory over the fat cats? Lecture them about trade? Or seek to win them over? “He’s not going to get up to the stage of Davos and insult them,” predicted Anne-Marie Slaughter, the president of New America, a Washington-based research organization, and a former director of policy planning at the State Department under President Barack Obama. “He’s so often a chameleon. He will adapt his message completely to the crowd. What he tweets, on the other hand, is likely to be very different.” No American president has attended Davos except Bill Clinton, who came in 2000, and many were perplexed that Mr. Trump, who styles himself as a billionaire populist, would choose to. “It’s so fascinating that he wanted to go,” said Karen Donfried, the president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research group that focuses on trans-Atlantic affairs, and a former national security aide to Mr. Obama. “Maybe he thinks these are his people, the corporate people. But his statements are to the other side.” To be sure, many of the American 1-percenters here have Mr. Trump to thank for the substantial corporate and personal tax cuts that he helped push through Congress in December. But privately, they consider him a global wild card and bristle at his efforts to build walls, figuratively and literally, against immigration and free trade. “Will political and corporate leaders at Davos seek to flatter Trump to get on his good side or give him the cold shoulder given their growing concerns about his leadership?” asked David J. Kramer, a former State Department official under President George W. Bush who just hosted a conference on foreign policy under Mr. Trump at Florida International University. Mr. Trump, after all, is the president who has taken a wrecking ball to the liberal international order that Davos represents. In his first year in office, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement with Asian nations, threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada as well as a separate trade pact with South Korea if they are not renegotiated to his liking, threatened a trade war with China and announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord now signed by every other nation in the world. He has also offended many by referring to African nations in a meeting with lawmakers as “shithole countries,” or some variation of that, and saying in another meeting that Nigerians who visit the United States would not want to “go back to their huts.” At least 10 heads of state or government from Africa are scheduled to attend this year, and Mr. Trump will meet with President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, the chairman of the African Union. But Davos participants rarely confront the grievances that globalization has produced in a visceral way, and some analysts said Mr. Trump’s message might be a bracing reminder that the wheeling and dealing has real-world effects on people far below this mountain retreat. “It’s important for the Davos elite to hear from the populist president who, although a billionaire businessman himself, is better able than they to understand what real people need in the United States and perhaps in other countries as well,” said Peter Van Praagh, the president of the Halifax International Security Forum, another annual gathering. “I hope President Trump brings with him to Davos a message to the business elite and to the political elite of some of the lessons he has learned as a candidate and in his first year in office, which is that making all of these issues real to people is the path to success,” Mr. Van Praagh added. “And although many of the people gathered at Davos intuitively understand this, they probably have a lot to learn from Mr. Trump.” Whether they will listen is another matter. And whether they will accept the messenger as an authentic envoy from the 99 percent or a wannabe member of the elite still banging on their door remains to be seen. “These same folks, as well as the business-media elite, generally find Trump to be a troublesome and boorish man,” Mr. D’Antonio said. “They may do what they can to ingratiate themselves, but privately and in some cases publicly they will reject him. He knows this as well as he knew that New York’s social elite rejected him in a similar way.”","DAVOS, Switzerland — By any measure, he made a lot of money, the kid from Queens, maybe not as much as he boasted, but a fortune.

Jerry Brown received repeated and intense criticism after he issued mandatory cuts on urban water use but exempted farmers. In a normal year, agriculture uses about 80 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid and will always pay at least 90 percent. The law allows stations that let people pump their own gas to be fined $50 to $500 (for repeat offenders). But none have been publicly penalized. It is possible that North Korea has already achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and has acquired nuclear warheads.” But experts said the main problem for North Korea is not miniaturization; the bombs are already judged small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, as a famous picture of Mr. Kim with an odd warhead resembling a disco ball seemed to make clear. The real test is whether a warhead can survive the intense heat of re-entry as it plunges through the atmosphere from space, who also spoke on behalf of Ms. Adcock, said she had not seen her 8-year-old daughter since the two were separated at an immigration detention facility in Arizona in early May. They had been apprehended by immigration officers somewhere in the desert. After her arrest, Angelica was flown to Las Vegas and transferred to a detention facility in Missouri. The federal authorities confirmed that he remained in custody, but would not comment on the possibility that the attack was connected to a bombing that took place Saturday morning in New Jersey, but the poll showed him losing support he once enjoyed among independents, women and public employee union households. By a wide margin, New Jersey voters said he was more concerned with running for president than running the state. On this last criticism, Mr. Christie seems unfazed. He met with reporters from national media outlets before the speech, causing a minor uproar among reporters for New Jersey outlets, who were shut out. He will spend Wednesday in South Carolina, delegating his powers, as he has for most of the past several years In other words, as the Trump economic team forms and tries to turn bold campaign promises into policy reality, it may find that the biggest limit of all is economic math. “We said from the very beginning: ‘ This isn’t our tax code. It belongs to the Chongqing Oriental Ferry Company. The company is state owned and reported to be deeply in debt. Last year the company reported assets of about $14.5 million and liabilities of more than twice that amount, or $29.8 million, according to records filed with the government. On Tuesday, Xinhua lowered the number of people onboard at the time of the attack given the mission’s perceived low risk. French attack helicopters responded to calls for help but it is unknown if they fired on the militants or only made a show of force. On a Sunday night, they distributed written and oral messages to bus owners and employees: “He who takes out a vehicle tomorrow is going to end up glued to his steering wheel.” To underscore their seriousness, they killed a driver and burned three microbuses as a warning.

The government has announced plans to more than triple non-oil revenue by 2020, starting with rising fees for visas, higher fines for traffic violations, and a sin tax on sugary drinks.

"On Friday evening, Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader and former first deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, went on a prominent Moscow radio station to exhort his fellow citizens to come out to protest President Vladimir Putin’s policies. There would be a rally on Sunday, a spring march, to demonstrate against the deepening economic crisis and Russia’s involvement in Ukraine. The most prominent Russian opposition leader, Aleksei Navalny, had been put in jail for 15 days, which just happened to be long enough to keep him from attending the rally. Nemtsov, who was older and, by now, less influential, had handed out leaflets in the metro and encouraged people to come anyway. After the radio show, on which Nemtsov warned that too much power in the hands of one man would “end in catastrophe,” he met Anna Duritskaya, his girlfriend of three years — and, as the police would later pointedly note, a citizen of Ukraine. They had dinner and then headed home, strolling across Red Square and past the swirling domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral, adjacent to the Kremlin. Just before midnight, as they crossed the bridge toward the historic Moscow neighborhood where Nemtsov lived, a white car pulled up, and, according to investigators, someone inside fired seven or eight shots. Four of them hit Nemtsov in the head, heart, liver and stomach, killing him on the spot. Duritskaya was unharmed and immediately taken in for questioning. Nemtsov, a big, broad man, was left on the pavement in the rain, his shirt yanked up to his chin. On Russian social media, liberal Moscow has struggled to wrap its head around something that seemed like it simply couldn’t happen, until it did. It had been years since Nemtsov, a rising star in Yeltsin-era politics, had been the standard-bearer of Western liberalism, and he could be a silly bon vivant. But he was deeply intelligent, witty, kind and ubiquitous. He seemed to genuinely be everyone’s friend; when I lived in Moscow as a journalist, he was always willing to jaw over endless glasses of cognac. And he was a powerful, vigorous critic of Vladimir Putin, assailing him in every possible medium, constantly publishing reports on topics like the president’s lavish lifestyle and the corruption behind the Sochi Olympics. How could such a prominent politician — a founder of the opposition Solidarity Party, a sitting member of the Yaroslavl city parliament — be gunned down so brazenly, within steps of the Kremlin? “We didn’t kill members of government,” Gleb Pavlovsky, an independent political consultant who used to work for Putin, told me over the phone. “It’s an absolutely new situation.” Olga Romanova, a prominent opposition activist and a close friend of Nemtsov, said, “There are more cameras in that spot than there are grains in a packet of grain.” When I called her last night, she had just come from the scene of the crime, where her friend still lay on the ground, surrounded by laughing policemen. “It’s the first time I’ve seen a very close person murdered, lying on the pavement,” she said. “It’s terrifying.” Putin promptly called Nemtsov’s mother to offer his condolences and threw what seemed like the entire Ministry of Internal Affairs on the case. Yet we can be sure that the investigation will lead precisely nowhere. At most, some sad sap, the supposed trigger-puller, will be hauled in front of a judge, the scapegoat for someone far more powerful. More likely, the case will founder for years amid promises that everyone is working hard, and no one will be brought to justice at all. This has been the pattern for other high-profile killings, like those of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya and the whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky. Already, the Kremlin is muddying the waters. Immediately after the shooting, Putin’s press secretary called the killing “a provocation.” This morning, he clarified that there was no political motive behind the murder. LifeNews, a publication with close ties to Russia’s security agencies, has suggested three possible theories that are under investigation: The killing might have been revenge for forcing Duritskaya to get an abortion; it might have had something to do with money Nemtsov was receiving from allies abroad; or it might have been an attempt to smear the Kremlin. By afternoon, the government’s Investigative Committee had issued a statement saying it believed Nemtsov may have been killed by someone from his own opposition movement who wanted to create a martyr. There was even a suggestion that the assassination was connected to the Charlie Hebdo killings. Even if one of these theories were true, none of Moscow’s embattled liberals would be convinced. “I will never believe it,” Yevgenia Albats, editor of the liberal magazine New Times and an old friend of Nemtsov, told me. “This is not about some domestic affair. These were absolute professionals.” Ilya Yashin, a member of Nemtsov’s Solidarity Party, was of the same mind. “It’s totally obvious for me that it’s a political killing,” he said. “I don’t have the slightest doubt about that.” Maxim Katz, another opposition activist, claimed on Twitter that, any way you slice it, Putin is responsible: “If he ordered it, then he’s guilty as the orderer. And even if he didn’t, then [he is responsible] as the inciter of hatred, hysteria, and anger among the people.” It’s hard to argue with this last point. Putin’s aggressive foreign policy, his increasingly conservative domestic policy, his labeling the opposition a “fifth column” and “national traitors,” his state television whipping up a militant, nationalistic fervor — all of this creates a certain atmosphere. Putin, after all, has a history of playing with fire, only to have the flames get away from him. After years of the Kremlin tacitly supporting ultranationalist, neo-Nazi groups, the same skinheads staged a violent protest at the foot of the Kremlin walls in 2010 while riot police officers stood by and watched helplessly. Today, a rabid nationalism has swallowed up most of the country, and it is no longer clear that Putin can control it. “In this kind of atmosphere, everything is possible,” Pavlovsky told me. “This is a Weimar atmosphere. There are no longer any limits.” Until relatively recently, the risks opposition activists knew they were taking on were not generally thought to be life-threatening. The government was likely to hassle activists and make their lives uncomfortable, but mostly it just marginalized them, like the town fool. This began to change with the arrests of protesters in the summer of 2012. When Navalny was sentenced to five years in prison a year later, it came as a shock; this had never been done before. Even after the sentence was suspended, it seemed to be a warning to the opposition. Nemtsov’s assassination took that warning to its logical conclusion. Now, “we live in a different political reality,” tweeted Leonid Volkov, a prominent opposition activist. “The fact that they killed him is a message to frighten everyone, the brave and the not brave,” Yashin said. “That this is what happens to people who go against the government of our country.” Anatoly Chubais — who, like Nemtsov, served in the Yeltsin government, and who remains close to Putin — visited the site of the shooting this morning. “If, just a few days ago, people in our city are carrying signs that say ‘Let’s finish off the fifth column,’ and today they kill Nemtsov,” he said in a statement, referring to the Kremlin-sponsored anti-Maidan protest in Moscow last weekend, “what will happen tomorrow?” Or, as Albats put it, “Hunting season is open.” Nemtsov had been confiding to friends of late that he was growing frightened. This summer, he went to Israel to hide out for a few months, fearing arrest. He told Albats that he worried he wouldn’t be able to withstand a stint in a Russian penal colony. In the fall, he filed a police report because of threats he was receiving on social media. It didn’t seem to go anywhere. Recently, he even let his bravado slip in public, telling an interviewer two weeks ago that he was scared Putin would kill him. And yet, he didn’t let up. According to Albats and Yashin, Nemtsov was working on a particularly incendiary report that he planned to call “Putin and Ukraine,” which would trace the stream of weaponry flowing from Russia to separatists in the Donbass. He was meeting with the families of Russian men who had died fighting with the separatists. He kept up his withering attacks on Facebook and Twitter. He kept traveling to Ukraine and meeting with president Petro Poroshenko, something that couldn’t have gone unnoticed by the Kremlin’s security agencies. And still, Nemtsov never hired a bodyguard. He walked home through Moscow late at night unprotected. And he almost made it. His apartment building was visible from the bridge. “From his window, where he worked out in the mornings, you can see the place where he was killed,” Romanova told me. “For many years, he saw the place where they would kill him.”","On Friday evening, Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader and former first deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, went on a prominent Moscow radio station to exhort his fellow citizens to come out to protest President Vladimir Putin’s policies.

"President Obama is so disciplined that his wife has teased that he eats precisely seven lightly salted almonds each night. George W. Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. But Donald J. Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation’s fast food president. “A ‘fish delight,’ sometimes, right?” Mr. Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town-hall-style meeting in February, extolling the virtues of McDonald’s. “The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It’s great stuff.” Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent. And so is his diet. In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Mr. Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn’t have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House. But in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts, Mr. Trump has broadcast his culinary preferences to the nation — devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (while reading The Wall Street Journal), feasting on a McDonald’s burger and fries (to celebrate clinching the Republican presidential nomination) and chowing down on a taco bowl (in an effort to woo Hispanic voters). He is a lover of diner fare and fast food grub, of overcooked steaks (“It would rock on the plate, it was so well done,” his longtime butler once observed) and the bland nourishment of Americana. He prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See’s Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee and alcohol. But his highbrow, lowbrow image — of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seatbelt buckles — is also a carefully crafted one. If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting “a splash” more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Mr. Trump’s diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them. “There’s nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,” said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. “It is the peculiarity of the brand that he’s able to be on his multimillion-dollar jet with the gold and black branding and colors, and at the same time eat KFC — and what makes it perfect is he does it all with a knife and fork, while reading The Wall Street Journal.” Or, as Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and pollster on the Trump campaign, put it, “It goes with his authenticity.” “I don’t think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye’s biscuits and fried chicken,” she said. Last April, Mrs. Clinton did, indeed, visit a Chipotle near Toledo, Ohio, stopping into the chain restaurant unrecognized, in black sunglasses, and ordering a chicken burrito bowl. And President Bill Clinton was perhaps the nation’s first fast food commander in chief, famous for ending his jogs at McDonald’s. (Mr. Clinton now adheres to a largely vegan diet.) Still, Mr. Trump seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely. While junk food has long been a staple of campaign trail life — Mitt Romney’s 2012 press corps coined the term “slunch” to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the “second lunch” — Mr. Trump’s reliance on high-calorie fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness. Though he often orders from the Trump Grill when working out of Trump Tower in Manhattan, he eats fast food several times a week while on the road because “it’s quick,” as he told The Daily Mail last year while munching on Burger King on his Boeing 757-200. Mr. Trump has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings. “We should be eating a hamburger on a conference table, and we should make better deals with China and others and forget the state dinners,” he said. A man always prone to distraction and uninterested in small details, he has never approached food as anything other than a problem to be solved, quickly, as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, an occasional dining partner, once told The Washington Examiner. As the two men ate at Jean-Georges in Manhattan in 2002, Mr. Trump ordered briskly and imperiously from the head chef and owner, Mr. Christie recalled. “Jean-Georges, remember the appetizer you made for me last week when I was here?” Mr. Trump asked the owner. “We’ll take two of those. And remember that main course you made, the special thing you made for me? We’ll take two of those, too.” Mr. Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe, he recalled in the interview. Mr. Trump looked at him and said, “Don’t worry, you’ll love it.” But Mr. Trump, who frets about germs and prizes cleanliness, also loves fast food because of its consistency and the promise, at least, of a basic level of hygiene. “One bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald’s. One bad hamburger, you take Wendy’s and all these other places and they’re out of business,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Cooper of CNN. “I’m a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you’re better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food’s coming from. It’s a certain standard.” Still, he added, “I think the food’s good.” Mr. Trump’s dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity, and parochialism — the kid from Queens who made it across the river to Manhattan’s glistening skyline, but never cottoned to the city’s haute cuisine. He once praised the “imagination” of his wife, Melania, in the kitchen — before citing, as examples of her culinary derring-do, spaghetti and meat sauce, salads and meatloaf. (He still keeps a copy of his mother’s meatloaf recipe.) Along with McDonald’s, his favorite fast food joint, a family member said, is Jackson Hole Burgers. He is also a stickler for manners, attacking his primary race rival, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, for scarfing down meals during impromptu news conferences. “I’ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion!” Mr. Trump told a crowd. And Mr. Trump, who sometimes sips his Diet Coke through a straw, once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a Famous Famiglia pizza restaurant in Times Square — and then proceeded to cut his oversize slice with a plastic knife and fork. He has other pretensions, as well. Howie Carr, a Boston Herald columnist, recalled traveling on Mr. Trump’s plane and watching him rip the buns off his McDonald’s patties before plying the burgers with ketchup. (“Do you know how many calories you save that way?” Mr. Trump asked Mr. Carr.) And Mr. Trump also told US Weekly that he tries to save calories on pizza. (“I scrape the toppings off my pizza — I never eat the dough,” he said.) So pronounced are Mr. Trump’s fast food preferences that Philip E. Beshara, a Washington-based lawyer, joked on Instagram that, as president, his cabinet would probably be staffed by Colonel Sanders, the Hamburglar and the Taco Bell Chihuahua. And, of course, the Republican nominee’s dining whims also keep his team on its toes, with staff members worrying not just about the backdrop for his speeches — but also where to find the nearest drive-through. “There’s never any real planning for food,” said one, between events on Friday. “It’s always just whatever he is craving, which is more often than not McDonald’s.”","President Obama is so disciplined that his wife has teased that he eats precisely seven lightly salted almonds each night.

President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home.
