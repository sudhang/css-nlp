"WASHINGTON — After decades of maintaining a minimal nuclear force, China has re-engineered many of its long-range ballistic missiles to carry multiple warheads, a step that federal officials and policy analysts say appears designed to give pause to the United States as it prepares to deploy more robust missile defenses in the Pacific. What makes China’s decision particularly notable is that the technology of miniaturizing warheads and putting three or more atop a single missile has been in Chinese hands for decades. But a succession of Chinese leaders deliberately let it sit unused; they were not interested in getting into the kind of arms race that characterized the Cold War nuclear competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, however, President Xi Jinping appears to have altered course, at the same moment that he is building military airfields on disputed islands in the South China Sea, declaring exclusive Chinese “air defense identification zones,” sending Chinese submarines through the Persian Gulf for the first time and creating a powerful new arsenal of cyberweapons. Many of those steps have taken American officials by surprise and have become evidence of the challenge the Obama administration faces in dealing with China, in particular after American intelligence agencies had predicted that Mr. Xi would focus on economic development and follow the path of his predecessor, who advocated the country’s “peaceful rise.” Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Beijing on Saturday to discuss a variety of security and economic issues of concern to the United States, although it remained unclear whether this development with the missiles, which officials describe as recent, was on his agenda. American officials say that, so far, China has declined to engage in talks on the decision to begin deploying multiple nuclear warheads atop its ballistic missiles. “The United States would like to have a discussion of the broader issues of nuclear modernization and ballistic missile defense with China,” said Phillip C. Saunders, director of the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at National Defense University, a Pentagon-funded academic institution attended by many of the military’s next cadre of senior commanders. “The Chinese have been reluctant to have that discussion in official channels,” Mr. Saunders said, although he and other experts have engaged in unofficial conversations with their Chinese counterparts on the warhead issue. Beijing’s new nuclear program was reported deep inside the annual Pentagon report to Congress about Chinese military capabilities, disclosing a development that poses a dilemma for the Obama administration, which has never talked publicly about these Chinese nuclear advances. President Obama is under more pressure than ever to deploy missile defense systems in the Pacific, although American policy officially states that those interceptors are to counter North Korea, not China. At the same time, the president is trying to find a way to signal that he will resist Chinese efforts to intimidate its neighbors, including some of Washington’s closest allies, and to keep the United States out of the Western Pacific. Already, there is talk in the Pentagon of speeding up the missile defense effort and of sending military ships into international waters near the disputed islands, to make it clear that the United States will insist on free navigation even in areas that China is claiming as its exclusive zone. Hans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, a policy research group in Washington, called the new deployments of Chinese warheads “a bad day for nuclear constraint.” “China’s little force is slowly getting a little bigger,” he said, “and its limited capabilities are slowly getting a little better.” To American officials, the Chinese move fits into a rapid transformation of their strategy under Mr. Xi, now considered one of the most powerful leaders since Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping. Vivid photographs, which were released recently, of Chinese efforts to reclaim land on disputed islands in the South China Sea and immediately build airfields on them, underscored for White House policy makers and military planners the speed and intensity of Mr. Xi’s determination to push potential competitors out into the mid-Pacific. That has involved building aircraft carriers and submarines to create an overall force that could pose a credible challenge to the United States in the event of a regional crisis. Some of China’s military modernization program has been aimed directly at America’s technological advantage. China has sought technologies to block American surveillance and communications satellites, and its major investments in cybertechnology — and probes and attacks on American computer networks — are viewed by American officials as a way to both steal intellectual property and prepare for future conflict. The upgrade to the nuclear forces fits into that strategy. “This is obviously part of an effort to prepare for long-term competition with the United States,” said Ashley J. Tellis, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who was a senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration. “The Chinese are always fearful of American nuclear advantage.” American nuclear forces today outnumber China’s by eight to one. The choice of which nuclear missiles to upgrade was notable, Mr. Tellis said, because China chose “one of few that can unambiguously reach the United States.” The United States pioneered multiple warheads early in the Cold War. The move was more threatening than simply adding arms. In theory, one missile could release warheads that adjusted their flight paths so each zoomed toward a different target. The term for the technical advance — multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle, or MIRV — became one of the Cold War’s most dreaded fixtures. It embodied the horrors of overkill and unthinkable slaughter. Each re-entry vehicle was a miniaturized hydrogen bomb. Each, by definition, was many times more destructive than the crude atomic weapon that leveled Hiroshima. China watched all this from the sidelines. Gingerly, it improved its warheads and missile forces in what amounted to baby steps, but chose to field a force that the leadership in Beijing believed could deter aggression with the smallest number of deployed warheads. In 1999, during the Clinton administration, Republicans in Congress charged that Chinese spies had stolen the secrets of H-bomb miniaturization. But intelligence agencies noted Beijing’s restraint. “For 20 years,” the C.I.A. reported, “China has had the technical capability to develop” missiles with multiple warheads and could, if so desired, upgrade its missile forces with MIRVs “in a few years.” The calculus shifted in 2004, when the Bush administration began deploying a ground-based antimissile system in Alaska and California. Early in 2013, the Obama administration, worrying about North Korean nuclear advances, ordered an upgrade. It called for the interceptors to increase in number to 44 from 30. While administration officials emphasized that Chinese missiles were not in the system’s cross hairs, they acknowledged that the growing number of interceptors might shatter at least some of Beijing’s warheads. Today, analysts see China’s addition of multiple warheads as at least partly a response to Washington’s antimissile strides. “They’re doing it,” Mr. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists said, “to make sure they could get through the ballistic missile defenses.” The Pentagon report, released on May 8, said that Beijing’s most powerful weapon now bore MIRV warheads. The intercontinental ballistic missile is known as the DF-5 (for Dong Feng, or East Wind). The Pentagon has said that China has about 20 in underground silos. Private analysts said each upgraded DF-5 had probably received three warheads and that the advances might span half the missile force. If so, the number of warheads China can fire from that weapon at the United States has increased to about 40 from 20. “It’s been a long time coming,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on Chinese nuclear forces at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In an interview, he emphasized that even fewer of the DF-5s might have received the upgrade. Early last week, Mr. Kristensen posted a public report on the missile intelligence. Beijing’s new membership in “the MIRV club,” he said, “strains the credibility of China’s official assurance that it only wants a minimum nuclear deterrent and is not part of a nuclear arms race.”","WASHINGTON — After decades of maintaining a minimal nuclear force, China has re-engineered many of its long-range ballistic missiles to carry multiple warheads, a step that federal officials and policy analysts say appears designed to give pause to the United States as it prepares to deploy more robust missile defenses in the Pacific.

What makes China’s decision particularly notable is that the technology of miniaturizing warheads and putting three or more atop a single missile has been in Chinese hands for decades. but was not deployed until now. The move comes just weeks before President Trump travels to Asia with his top national security advisers on what will be an unusually large trip focused heavily on North Korea, which last week tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile yet. In addition to the new capability, China also announced this month that it had successfully test-fired a hypersonic glide vehicle capable of striking targets anywhere in the world. “China is clearly signaling they are willing to use their nuclear forces against U.S. second strike capabilities,” said Frank A. Gaffney Jr., president of the Center for Security Policy who advised Mr. Trump during the campaign about defense issues. “They have made clear they want us to think twice when we contemplate trying to defend ourselves from them.” While China has always maintained a significant arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate-range land-based missiles, those weapons were never intended to target the continental United States because American anti-missile systems could intercept them well above Earth’s atmosphere. But over time, China began developing longer-ranged missiles that can fly farther than 3,400 miles, deep into the Western Hemisphere. Those include the Dong Feng 26 (DF-26), known by NATO code name YJ-18, which is believed to have a range of up to 950 miles; the DF-31A, which carries three MIRVed warheads and has a range exceeding 700 miles; and the submarine-launched JL-2, which is estimated to have a range between 2,000 and 2,500 nautical miles. With each launch, Beijing has added another layer of complexity to any potential conflict involving the two countries. Now, if the Pentagon deploys additional missile defenses in Guam, Hawaii and Alaska, China might decide to respond by using one of these newer, multiwarhead missiles rather than the older ones that would likely be destroyed by the American system. It remains unclear whether the deployment of such weaponry would lead to an escalation toward full-scale nuclear exchange. But the development underscores how much uncertainty there still is regarding the intentions behind China’s military modernization efforts. Many experts believe that while China may be seeking regional hegemony in East Asia, it does not seek global dominance like Russia under Vladimir V. Putin. Still, some scholars argue that China’s behavior suggests otherwise: Its military buildup includes stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and other sophisticated equipment that indicate an intention to challenge the United States across all domains of power. And although China has signed treaties banning biological and chemical weapons, it continues to develop offensive cyberweapons and space-related technologies, including satellites used for intelligence gathering. Last year, China conducted five times as many tests of ground-to-ground rockets compared with the previous decade, according to data compiled by the Missile Defense Project, part of the Union of Concerned Scientists. This year alone, the country launched eight different types of missiles, ranging from conventional cruise and surface-to-air models to the newest generation of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Some of the tests appeared aimed directly at the United States, raising concerns among lawmakers and former senior government officials. For example, on July 27, China fired a DF-26 missile from Xichang Air Force Base near Chengdu City in Sichuan Province. According to the Missile Defense Agency, the rocket flew approximately 1,500 kilometers, passing within 250 kilometers of Taiwan and landing inside Japanese territorial waters. That same day, the State Department issued a statement condemning the test, saying that “the flight path of this missile demonstrated once again the threat posed by China’s destabilizing, militarily significant activities around and beyond its territory.” On Aug. 3, China carried out four separate tests of the DF-26, firing it from multiple locations throughout western China. Two days later, it launched six more DF-26s — a record number for a single test — from the eastern coastal city of Qingdao, where the Chinese navy maintains a base. All seven rockets traveled thousands of miles through airspace controlled by Japan or South Korea before crashing harmlessly into the sea. Although China did not announce the purpose of the tests, analysts speculated that they were designed to demonstrate the missile’s range and accuracy as well as its ability to penetrate American defenses in Asia. The United States has deployed advanced antimissiles around Seoul and Tokyo but is still developing an effective system capable of shooting down incoming ballistic missiles over long distances at high altitudes. In addition, the Pentagon has been trying since 2013 to develop a new generation of interceptor missiles with greater speed and maneuverability than current models. A successful demonstration would have given Beijing confidence that it could overcome any such defense. “The message was clear: We can reach you anywhere,” said Zhou Chenming, a retired colonel who commanded a regiment equipped with medium-range missiles during his service in the People’s Liberation Army. He said he believed that the launches had demonstrated both the weapon’s potential and its limitations. “It’s very difficult to destroy these types of missiles once they are inside your territory.” But the tests also raised questions about how far away from their intended targets the weapons might be able to travel without being detected until too late. One of the two Japanese officials familiar with the details of last month’s drill said the missiles flew farther than expected because of unforeseen wind patterns. That official added that the trajectory of one rocket appeared to suggest that it had flown even deeper into the Pacific Ocean than planned. While the flight paths remained classified, the Japanese government estimated that each missile traveled between 450 kilometers (about 280 miles) and 700 kilometers (more than 435 miles). If true, those ranges would exceed what experts say is necessary to hit major cities like Osaka or Nagoya on Honshu Island, which lie closer to North Korean artillery positions near the Sea of Japan. It remains unclear whether the missiles could strike targets further west along the island chain, including Okinawa Prefecture, home to several important military bases. Still, the fact that the Chinese tested so many missiles within just three weeks suggested that they may now possess enough capability to threaten every part of Japan except the northernmost islands off Hokkaido. “This is really something we need to take seriously if this becomes routine practice,” said Toshi Yoshihara, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Mr. Yoshihara noted that the tests coincided with preparations for President Trump’s visit to Japan next weekend for talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “There will certainly be discussions about deterring threats posed by North Korea and China, especially after Pyongyang conducted another nuclear test earlier today,” he wrote in an email. The latest round of testing came less than four months after North Korea claimed to have successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb aboard an intercontinental ballistic missile. At least five other countries besides China — Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel and France — already operate similar weapons systems. And while the United States has yet to deploy them domestically, some believe that a version called Ground Based Interceptors, or GBI, could become operational soon. Last year, the Pentagon began work on a program known as Redesigned Kill Vehicle, or RKV, aimed at improving the performance of existing interceptors. But despite years of development costs, the program has suffered repeated setbacks and delays. The Pentagon plans to conduct additional tests of the GBI early next year, according to a spokesman, Lt. Col. Christopher Sherwood. “We remain confident that our homeland defense capabilities are strong against all currently fielded ICBMs,” Colonel Sherwood said. “Our goal continues to be to improve upon the effectiveness of our homeland defense posture across all domains.” Some experts question why China needs to keep testing its own arsenals when it appears to rely heavily on Russian technology. They note that the country does not appear to have developed the sophisticated guidance systems needed to ensure that warheads actually hit their intended targets."
"KABUL, Afghanistan — Soon, American Embassy employees in Kabul will no longer need to take a Chinook helicopter ride to cross the street to a military base less than 100 yards outside the present Green Zone security district. Instead, the boundaries of the Green Zone will be redrawn to include that base, known as the Kabul City Compound, formerly the headquarters for American Special Operations forces in the capital. The zone is separated from the rest of the city by a network of police, military and private security checkpoints. The expansion is part of a huge public works project that over the next two years will reshape the center of this city of five million to bring nearly all Western embassies, major government ministries, and NATO and American military headquarters within the protected area. After 16 years of American presence in Kabul, it is a stark acknowledgment that even the city’s central districts have become too difficult to defend from Taliban bombings. But the capital project is also clearly taking place to protect another long-term American investment: Along with an increase in troops to a reported 15,000, from around 11,000 at the moment, the Trump administration’s new strategy for Afghanistan is likely to keep the military in place well into the 2020s, even by the most conservative estimates. No one wants to say when any final pullout will take place, because the emphasis now is on a conditions-based withdrawal — presumably meaning after the Afghan government can handle the war alone. But President Trump has kept secret the details of those conditions, and how they are defined. “Until he says what the conditions are, all that means is we’ll be there as long as we want, for whatever reason we want,” said Barnett Rubin, a longtime Afghanistan expert who advised the Obama administration. “And they don’t have to lie to do that, because the conditions will never be good enough to say we’re absolutely not needed.” In practical terms, it means that the American military mission will continue for many more years, despite its unpopularity with the American public. Many military strategists, in America and Afghanistan, have already penciled in plans well into the ’20s, and certainly past any Trump re-election campaign. At the NATO summit meeting in Warsaw last year, the allies, including the United States, agreed to fund the development of the Afghan security forces until the end of what was termed “the transition decade,” meaning from 2014, when Afghan forces began to take charge of their own security, until 2024. “I would guess the U.S. has to plan on being inside Afghanistan for a decade or more in order for there to be any type of resolution,” said Bill Roggio, editor of Long War Journal. “It’s definitely past his first term in office, no two ways about it.” The Green Zone expansion is aimed at making it possible for America and its NATO allies to remain in the capital without facing the risks that have in the past year made Kabul the most dangerous place in Afghanistan, with more people killed there than anywhere else in the country — mostly from suicide bombers. Kabul’s security area had long been a Green Zone-lite compared with its fortresslike predecessor in Baghdad, where there are massive blast walls and a total separation from the general population, enforced by biometric entry passes. In Kabul, thousands of Afghans still commute to jobs and even schools inside the zone, with only light searches for most of them, mindful of the resentment stirred by the Soviets’ heavily militarized central zone during their Afghan occupation. And the Green Zone in Baghdad has, its critics maintain, created an out-of-touch ruling class and Western community, and provided a magnet for protests while just moving enormous bombings elsewhere, further stoking popular discontent with leaders and foreigners. The Kabul Green Zone expansion, which will significantly restrict access, was prompted, according to both Afghan and American military officials, by a huge suicide bomb planted in a sewage truck that exploded at a gate of the current Green Zone on May 31, destroying most of the German Embassy and killing more than 150 people. The loss of life could have been far worse, but Germany had evacuated its embassy a week before the bombing, apparently tipped off by intelligence sources. The military recently appointed an American brigadier general to take charge of greatly expanding and fortifying the Green Zone. In the first stage of the project, expected to take from six months to a year, an expanded Green Zone will be created — covering about 1.86 square miles, up from 0.71 square miles — closing off streets within it to all but official traffic. Because that will also cut two major arteries through the city, in an area where traffic congestion is already rage-inducing for Afghan drivers, the plans call for building a ring road on the northern side of the Wazir Akbar Khan hill to carry traffic around the new Green Zone. In a final stage, a still bigger Blue Zone will be established, encompassing most of the city center, where severe restrictions on movement — especially by trucks — will be put in place. Already, height restriction barriers have been built over roads throughout Kabul to block trucks. Eventually, all trucks seeking to enter Kabul will be routed through a single portal, where they will be X-rayed and searched. The process of turning Kabul into a fortress started before Mr. Trump took office, of course — security measures were tightened and an obtrusive network of blast walls was established in some places years before President Barack Obama left office. Some of the plans for long-term American assistance in Afghanistan were already in place, too, and have been enhanced. An ambitious $6.5 billion program to build a serious Afghan Air Force is scheduled to take until 2023. In Brussels last October, the United States and other donor nations agreed to continue $15 billion in development funding for the country through 2020. Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has suggested that American forces would remain in Afghanistan until victory. But even his own generals have conceded that a complete military victory in Afghanistan is not possible. The only solution most see is to persuade the Taliban to sit down to peace talks — something they have refused to do as long as American soldiers remain in the country. And with the insurgents gaining ground steadily in the past two years, the Taliban have even less incentive to negotiate. “It seems America is not yet ready to end the longest war in its history,” said the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, after Mr. Trump announced his new policy. “As Trump stated, ‘Americans are weary of the long war in Afghanistan.’ We shall cast further worry into them and force American officials to accept realities.” The Afghan ambassador to Washington, Hamdullah Mohib, said that talking about how much longer Americans may stay in Afghanistan obscures how different the years to come will be from the first 16 years. “I think a lot of the discussions when people talk about American presence in Afghanistan, the memory comes of when they were actively involved in combat and bodies were coming back to the United States. That is no longer the case,” Mr. Mohib said. “The majority of those soldiers are helping us improve our logistics, organizational capabilities, putting systems in place. While yes, there is an element of counterterrorism operations, it’s largely airstrikes supporting the Afghan special forces.” Despite the long-term scenario most military planners have embraced, there are still some dates that could disrupt the calendar. Next year, the country will hold elections for a new Parliament — three years late — but there are concerns that preparations for the elections will not be completed in time. An even greater concern is the following year, 2019, when presidential elections are due. The last presidential election, in 2014, was a fiasco, and amid accusations of fraud and vote-rigging, the outcome ended up in an American-negotiated deal to form a shaky coalition government. The United States may be willing to look past another tainted election, though the last one nearly devolved into factional conflict. Europe and the NATO allies, however, may be another matter; they have repeatedly insisted on clean and credible elections as a condition for continued support. “This may be our last golden opportunity,” said Haroun Mir, an Afghan political analyst. “If we cannot solve our problems by 2019, if we move to an ethnic conflict, this may spread to the Afghan security forces, and that would undermine the entire U.S. effort in Afghanistan.” He doubts the United States would stay if that happened. For now, though, the Americans and their allies seem ready to dig in. The Taliban have been fond of quoting an old Afghan saying: “You have the watches, we have the time.” After Mr. Trump announced his new strategy, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, used a televised speech to turn that expression on its head: “The Taliban should go buy a watch,” he said, because time was now on the government’s side.","KABUL, Afghanistan — Soon, American Embassy employees in Kabul will no longer need to take a Chinook helicopter ride to cross the street to a military base less than 100 yards outside the present Green Zone security district.

The move is part of an effort by President Obama’s administration to reduce its footprint across Afghanistan while still maintaining some presence there after most troops are gone this year. But it also reflects how much has changed since the United States invaded Afghanistan nearly 13 years ago: Even if the Taliban have not been defeated, they do not control any major city anymore; even though violence remains high, the country does not seem headed toward civil war again; and even though the government of President Ashraf Ghani is weak, he is trying to make peace with his enemies rather than fight them. “We don’t want our diplomats living behind walls,” said James Dobbins, a former senior State Department official involved in negotiating the deal between Mr. Ghani and Gen. John F. Campbell, then commander of international forces in Afghanistan. “The idea was to get out of the old compounds.” In addition to reducing troop levels from more than 9,800 today to zero by next December, the Pentagon plans to shutter several bases around the country before the end of September. A few hundred Marines will remain in Helmand Province until October but will leave their main base there soon. They may return later to help train local police units, officials say. At least one other Marine base in southern Afghanistan will close soon, too. And the Army Corps of Engineers will pull back all its personnel working on construction projects throughout the country except those helping build up the Afghan National Security Forces. All told, the number of foreign soldiers left in Afghanistan will fall below 10,000 when the last American soldier leaves Bagram Air Base near Kabul early next month. That is down sharply from the peak force of 140,000 deployed here during the height of combat operations against insurgents. Still, the United States will retain a small counterterrorism team inside the Interior Ministry building downtown that helps coordinate intelligence-gathering efforts among various agencies and provides advice to Afghan commandos fighting Islamist militants. It will continue training Afghan pilots and air controllers so they can fly fighter jets and transport planes bought from the West. And it will keep running drone surveillance flights over Pakistan and elsewhere. Most important, the C.I.A.’s paramilitary teams operating undercover in Afghan villages and cities will stay put. Those specialists are crucial because the Taliban, despite being pushed into remote areas where they cannot easily attack urban centers like Kabul, have shown little sign of losing momentum. Last week, the group killed two members of Parliament in eastern Paktia province, just days after killing another lawmaker in neighboring Logar province. Both attacks were claimed by the Taliban. The latest killings come amid increasing reports that the Taliban are regrouping in northern provinces bordering Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, raising fears that they could stage a comeback similar to what happened in Iraq following the withdrawal of Western forces there. To prevent such a scenario, the Obama administration wants to ensure that enough American advisory teams remain embedded within the Afghan army and police to provide guidance and support to officers on the ground. There are currently roughly 7,600 American service members providing assistance to the Afghan armed forces through Operation Resolute Support, which began late last summer. While many of these troops are stationed at large bases outside the country’s big cities, others live alongside Afghans in garrison towns and rural districts. Some embed themselves directly with individual battalion commands. Officials expect that the total number of coalition forces remaining in Afghanistan will drop to fewer than 10,000 once the final contingent departs Bagram, including the 1,000 American troops already scheduled to go home by the end of August. Of course, the numbers alone tell only half the story. For example, the number of British troops in Afghanistan dropped to five earlier this year, but Britain continues to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to fundamentally transform the Afghan military. As part of that effort, the British government recently announced that it would send additional instructors to teach tactics to Afghan Special Operations Commandos — elite troops trained for direct action missions. This type of mission is exactly what the United States hopes to avoid as it tries to wind down involvement in Afghanistan without leaving it vulnerable to extremist takeover. So far, however, the Taliban appear undeterred. On Thursday, the movement released a video showing a group of fighters dressed like American commandos taking part in an exercise with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at their side. The footage was shot from above; it showed the men training on open fields near Kunduz Province. It also included interviews with some of them about how they had been taught by foreigners. “The Americans are teaching us all kinds of things,” one said. Another added: “They’re telling you which way to go when you attack.” In recent years, there have been reports of such activities across northern Afghanistan. But this time around, the videos were filmed not only during the day but also after dark, suggesting that the militants may be getting more sophisticated in using night vision goggles or other equipment supplied by Western nations. Last year, the Pentagon acknowledged that it had provided the insurgents with “some” night vision devices. And the United Nations has reported that the Taliban now possess helicopters, drones and surveillance aircraft. While the exact source of these weapons remains unclear, evidence suggests that many come from Pakistan, where Islamabad maintains close ties with the Taliban leadership. For its part, Washington continues to deny providing any military assistance directly to the Taliban. But the new videos suggest that even if the United States does not intend to arm the enemy, it might still unwittingly end up arming its enemies indirectly through allies who do so willingly. That could further complicate President Obama’s efforts to withdraw thousands of American forces from Afghanistan over the next two years while ensuring that the country does not fall back into chaos. As he prepares to announce his decision on Friday regarding troop levels beyond 2016, Mr. Obama faces another challenge: How can he ensure that Afghans themselves remain committed to fighting terrorism? Since the start of last month, the number of attacks carried out against civilians has increased significantly compared with previous months, according to data collected by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. There have already been several major assaults in Kabul alone since January, including suicide bombings outside a bank and a police station. These incidents have killed hundreds of people, mostly civilians, and wounded scores more. Some analysts say that the Taliban’s apparent ability to acquire increasingly advanced weaponry points toward greater cooperation between the Pakistani intelligence services and the Taliban. One example came earlier this week, when the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing three members of the security detail assigned to Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, president of Afghanistan. Two bodyguards were among those killed. According to the Associated Press news agency, the attack took place just before dawn, when the guards were returning home from work. Their bodies were found lying along a roadside littered with bullet casings. The Taliban often use similar methods to carry out assassinations in Afghan cities. They typically target high-profile individuals and try to kill them in broad daylight, hoping to cause maximum carnage. Such attacks usually involve multiple gunmen armed with pistols, machine guns and explosives. In addition to the latest round of violence, the Taliban have continued to stage large-scale offensives throughout the winter. Most recently, the militant group launched a coordinated assault against Afghan Security Forces in Helmand province, the birthplace of the Taliban. More than half of the nation’s opium poppy crop comes from the region, making it rich in resources that help fund the insurgency. During the five days of clashes, the Taliban managed to seize control of parts of Lashkar Gah district, the provincial capital. Although the battle ended on Monday, the city remained under threat because of persistent sniping and mortar fire. Even though the Afghan Army eventually regained full control of the area, the episode raised questions about whether the army was ready to fight without international support. Afterward, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., warned that the conflict was likely to intensify."
"MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted by advanced spyware sold to the Mexican government on the condition that it be used only to investigate criminals and terrorists. The targets include lawyers looking into the mass disappearance of 43 students, a highly respected academic who helped write anti-corruption legislation, two of Mexico’s most influential journalists and an American representing victims of sexual abuse by the police. The spying even swept up family members, including a teenage boy. Since 2011, at least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased about $80 million worth of spyware created by an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer. The software, known as Pegasus, infiltrates smartphones to monitor every detail of a person’s cellular life — calls, texts, email, contacts and calendars. It can even use the microphone and camera on phones for surveillance, turning a target’s smartphone into a personal bug. The company that makes the software, the NSO Group, says it sells the tool exclusively to governments, with an explicit agreement that it be used only to battle terrorists or the drug cartels and criminal groups that have long kidnapped and killed Mexicans. But according to dozens of messages examined by The New York Times and independent forensic analysts, the software has been used against some of the government’s most outspoken critics and their families, in what many view as an unprecedented effort to thwart the fight against the corruption infecting every limb of Mexican society. “We are the new enemies of the state,” said Juan E. Pardinas, the general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, who has pushed anti-corruption legislation. His iPhone, along with his wife’s, was targeted by the software, according to an independent analysis. “Ours is a society where democracy has been eroded,” he said. The deployment of sophisticated cyberweaponry against citizens is a snapshot of the struggle for Mexico itself, raising profound legal and ethical questions for a government already facing severe criticism for its human rights record. Under Mexican law, only a federal judge can authorize the surveillance of private communications, and only when officials can demonstrate a sound basis for the request. It is highly unlikely that the government received judicial approval to hack the phones, according to several former Mexican intelligence officials. Instead, they said, illegal surveillance is standard practice. “Mexican security agencies wouldn’t ask for a court order, because they know they wouldn’t get one,” said Eduardo Guerrero, a former analyst at the Center for Investigation and National Security, Mexico’s intelligence agency and one of the government agencies that use the Pegasus spyware. “I mean, how could a judge authorize surveillance of someone dedicated to the protection of human rights?” “There, of course, is no basis for that intervention, but that is besides the point,” he added. “No one in Mexico ever asks for permission to do so.” The hacking attempts were highly personalized, striking critics with messages designed to inspire fear — and get them to click on a link that would provide unfettered access to their cellphones. Carmen Aristegui, one of Mexico’s most famous journalists, was targeted by a spyware operator posing as the United States Embassy in Mexico, instructing her to click on a link to resolve an issue with her visa. The wife of Mr. Pardinas, the anti-corruption activist, was targeted with a message claiming to offer proof that he was having an extramarital affair. For others, imminent danger was the entry point, like a message warning that a truck filled with armed men was parked outside Mr. Pardinas’s home. “I think that any company that sells a product like this to a government would be horrified by the targets, of course, which don’t seem to fall into the traditional role of criminality,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, which examined the hacking attempts. The Mexican government acknowledges gathering intelligence against legitimate suspects in accordance with the law. “As in any democratic government, to combat crime and threats against national security the Mexican government carries out intelligence operations,” it said in a statement. But the government “categorically denies that any of its members engages in surveillance or communications operations against defenders of human rights, journalists, anti-corruption activists or any other person without prior judicial authorization.” The Mexican government’s deployment of spyware has come under suspicion before, including hacking attempts on political opponents and activists fighting corporate interests in Mexico. Still, there is no ironclad proof that the Mexican government is responsible. The Pegasus software does not leave behind the hacker’s individual fingerprints. Even the software maker, the NSO Group, says it cannot determine who, exactly, is behind specific hacking attempts. But cyberexperts can verify when the software has been used on a target’s phone, leaving them with few doubts that the Mexican government, or some rogue actor within it, was involved. “This is pretty much as good as it gets,” said Bill Marczak, another senior researcher at Citizen Lab, who confirmed the presence of NSO code on several phones belonging to Mexican journalists and activists. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that cybercriminals somehow got their hands on the software, the NSO Group says, because the technology can be used only by the government agency where it is installed. The company is part of a growing number of digital spying businesses that operate in a loosely regulated space. The market has picked up in recent years, particularly as companies like Apple and Facebook start encrypting their customers’ communications, making it harder for government agencies to conduct surveillance. Increasingly, governments have found that the only way to monitor mobile phones is by using private businesses like the NSO Group that exploit little-known vulnerabilities in smartphone software. The company has, at times, operated its businesses under different names. One of them, OSY Technologies, paid Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, more than $40,000 to be an advisory board member from May 2016 until January, according to his public financial disclosures. Before selling to governments, the NSO Group says, it vets their human rights records. But once the company licenses the software and installs its hardware inside intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the company says, it has no way of knowing how its spy tools are used — or whom they are used against. The company simply bills governments based on the total number of surveillance targets. To spy on 10 iPhone users, for example, the company charges $650,000 on top of a flat $500,000 installation fee, according to NSO marketing proposals reviewed by The New York Times. Even when the NSO Group learns that its software has been abused, there is only so much it can do, the company says, arguing that it cannot simply march into intelligence agencies, remove its hardware and take back its spyware. “When you’re selling AK-47s, you can’t control how they’ll be used once they leave the loading docks,” said Kevin Mahaffey, chief technology officer at Lookout, a mobile security company. Rather, the NSO Group relies on its customers to cooperate in a review, then turns over the findings to the appropriate governmental authority — in effect, leaving governments to police themselves. Typically, the company’s only recourse is to slowly cut off a government’s access to the spy tools over the course of months, or even years, by ceasing to provide new software patches, features and updates. But in the case of Mexico, the NSO Group has not condemned or even acknowledged any abuse, despite repeated evidence that its spy tools have been deployed against ordinary citizens and their families. Journalists, human rights defenders and anti-corruption campaigners have long faced enormous risks in Mexico. For decades, they have been followed, harassed, threatened and even killed for their work, occupational hazards more common in authoritarian states than in countries in good standing with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as Mexico is. But when President Enrique Peña Nieto came into office in 2012, promising to lift Mexico to its rightful place on the world stage, there was an inkling of hope that the nation’s democracy was coming into its own. His party passed a list of badly needed changes, taking aim at the failing education system and moving to enhance the transparency of Mexico’s bureaucracy. Competition in some core industries, like telecommunications, has increased. But by 2014, much of the early promise of the Peña Nieto administration was dashed by the crises subsuming it, including the mysterious disappearance of 43 teaching students after a clash with the police, and accusations that the president and his wife got a special deal on a multimillion-dollar home from a government contractor. The scandals have left an enduring mark on the president’s reputation. After a stunning rise built on a perfectly crafted image — a young, energetic president working across party lines, the embodiment of a new Mexico — Mr. Peña Nieto was suddenly recast as an out-of-touch, corrupt politician with abysmal approval ratings. In no small part, that fall was thanks to the Mexican journalists who broke news of the scandals, as well as the lawyers and activists who refused to let the country forget about them. “You have to remember this was a government that went from setting the agenda to being entirely reactive,” said Carlos Loret de Mola, a news anchor for Televisa who has some of the best sources inside the Mexican government. Mr. Loret de Mola, who received at least eight messages laced with NSO software, added, “They looked at journalists and thought, ‘They are bringing these things out and embarrassing us, so it’s better if we spy on them.’” Mexico is still a far cry from Turkey, which jails more journalists than any other nation in the world. It is hardly China, an authoritarian state where critics are silenced and a Western-style free press has been cast as a political peril by the government. But Mexico is in crisis on these fronts all the same. More journalists were killed in Mexico last year than during any other year this century, and 2017 is off to an even worse start. Government critics are routinely harassed and threatened, and now they are being targeted with incredibly sophisticated software. “The fact that the government is using high-tech surveillance against human rights defenders and journalists exposing corruption, instead of those responsible for those abuses, says a lot about who the government works for,” said Luis Fernando García, the executive director of R3D, a digital rights group in Mexico that has helped identify multiple abuses of Pegasus in Mexico. “It’s definitely not for the people.” Perhaps no journalist in Mexico has done as much to damage the reputation of the president than Carmen Aristegui. And few have paid as dearly for it. In 2014, she and her team broke the scandal of the so-called Casa Blanca, or White House, a story of real estate intrigue that involved a special deal handed to Mexico’s first lady, Angélica Rivera, by a major government contractor close to the president. The story reached a worldwide audience and forced the president’s wife to surrender the house, presenting the Mexican government with the sort of ethical quandary that in a different country might result in a congressional inquiry or the appointment of an independent prosecutor. Instead, the president was cleared of wrongdoing by a prosecutor who had worked closely with his campaign team, while Ms. Aristegui lost her job. That moment marked the beginning of a sustained campaign of harassment and defamation against her: lawsuits, break-ins at her offices, threats to her safety and the monitoring of her movements. “It’s been about getting revenge for the piece,” she said. “There’s really no other way to see it.” So when she began receiving text messages in 2015 from unknown numbers, instructing her to click on a link, she was suspicious. One message asked for her help in locating a missing child. Another alerted her to sudden charge on her credit card. And she received a text message purportedly from the American Embassy about a problem with her visa. Impersonating an American government official is a possible violation of United States law. When the messages failed to entice her to click on the links and inadvertently download the software, they grew increasingly strident, including one warning that she could be imprisoned. Several came from the same phone number, leaving a record of the spyware operator’s sloppiness. Still, the spyware operators pressed on. Starting as early as March, they began targeting Ms. Aristegui’s then-16-year-old son, Emilio, who was living in the United States at the time. Some of the texts were similar to the ones she had received. Others were made-up headlines about Ms. Aristegui, sent from what appeared to be a news agency. “The only reason they could be going after my son is in the hopes of finding something against me, to damage me,” she said. Ms. Aristegui is the embodiment of the hope — and the crushing limitations — for a free media in Mexico. Though she was fired over what her employer called internal disagreements, she continued publishing on her own, eventually drawing enough of an audience to sustain a team of reporters. But the work has taken its toll. In one lawsuit, filed by the president of her former employer, a judge cited Ms. Aristegui last November for her “excessive use of freedom of speech.” Her website, Aristegui Noticias, has been hacked numerous times, including on the eve of publishing a major investigation into the massacre of more than a dozen civilians by the federal police. And her offices were broken into last November. So brazen were the assailants that they didn’t bother wearing masks. Nor did they steal much — one computer, a watch and a bag hanging from the back of a chair. Their faces and fingerprints were captured on cameras in the office. Still, no one has been caught. The threats, harassment, even the spying, all of it she channels into work. “For me, I have opted to believe that my public work is what will best protect me,” she said. “The great challenge for journalists and citizens is that the fear serve us, and not conquer us.” It was Dec. 21, 2015, and Mr. Pardinas was at the beach with his family, trying to enjoy the start of his Christmas vacation. But his phone kept buzzing, at first with calls from lawyers, and then with an odd text message. It had been a long few months in an even longer campaign: to pass an unprecedented law forcing Mexico’s public servants to disclose their financial conflicts of interest. In November, he had presented a study on the costs of corruption in Mexico, confirming with facts and figures something that nearly all Mexicans knew in their hearts — that corruption was crippling the country. He followed it up with media interviews, poking fun at the Mexican government’s embarrassing response to corruption. He joked that it probably spent more money on coffee and cookies than on the office in charge of prosecuting graft. The study, the interviews, a seemingly endless gantlet of meetings with politicians — it all laid the groundwork for the new law, which Mr. Pardinas, a private citizen directing a public policy group, was helping to write. So even as Christmas approached and his family relaxed in the coastal town of Puerto Vallarta, Mr. Pardinas was busily consulting lawyers on the final draft, which he had just over a month to submit. And then a message: “My father died at dawn, we are devastated, I’m sending you the details of the wake, I hope you can come.” Attached was a link. Mr. Pardinas thought it odd that whoever had sent such a personal text was not even among the contacts in his phone. He showed his wife the message, and decided to ignore it. Things only picked up from there, both on his proposed law and the odd messages. The government roundly ignored his bill, until he and others gathered more than 630,000 signatures supporting it. Mr. Pardinas’s tone grew bolder. He told one radio host that “for the government of Mexico, anti-corruption measures are like garlic to a vampire.” Then came another text message. This one appeared to be from the news outlet Uno TV, which sends daily news headlines to cellphone users across the country. The headline struck him: “The History of Corruption Within the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.” It was particularly alarming because that was his organization. He declined once more to click on the link, suspecting foul play. More text messages came, including the next day. Only this time, having failed with Mr. Pardinas, they tried his wife. The message, sent from the same news headline service, said that leaked videos showed Mr. Pardinas having sexual relations with a member of his staff. It was also sent to a colleague. Mr. Pardinas called his wife, telling her that she appeared to be part of a broader harassment effort. “Oh, it’s these people again,” she responded. The campaign to pass the law continued, and the bill made it through Congress relatively unscathed. But the Senate decided to add an extra provision: Everyone who worked for a company that received government money would also have to disclose their interests and assets. That meant the bill would cover more than 30 million people. The president vetoed the bill, saying it needed more discussion, essentially kicking the can down the road. Mr. Pardinas continued his broadsides in interviews, naming obstructive lawmakers and well-connected companies that benefited from government money. Few activists go so far as to name names in interviews, but Mr. Pardinas, who holds a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics, plowed ahead anyway. The initiative seemed doomed. Yet another message arrived, on Aug. 1, this one laced with menace: “Listen, outside of your house is a truck with two armed guys, I took their photo look at them and be careful.” Mr. Pardinas, who was at work when this message came, once again declined to take the bait. But he did call his wife, again, asking her to look out their window to see if there was a truck parked outside. There was not. “By the end, my wife had Olympic-style training in this hacking stuff,” Mr. Pardinas said. Mario E. Patrón was on edge. The conference table was packed with fellow human rights defenders, including the United Nations commissioner for human rights in Mexico. Everyone was there to discuss the bombshell expected to drop. An international panel brought to Mexico to investigate the haunting disappearance of 43 teaching students was releasing its final report the next day, at the end of April 2016. The findings, Mr. Patrón knew, were going to be brutal. The government would be accused of negligence, incompetence, even malfeasance in its handling of the case. Like others in the room, Mr. Patrón, whose organization represents the parents of the missing students, was wondering how the government would respond. His phone buzzed and he glanced at the screen. “THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO GETS OUT IN FRONT OF THE GIEI,” the text message read, using the acronym for the international panel. It seemed like the news he had been waiting for. He showed the message to his colleague, then clicked on the link. But instead of an article or a news release, it simply redirected him to a blank page. Confused, he left the meeting and raced to his office to begin making calls to see what the government had in store. And like that, he fell into their trap. Mr. Patrón is the executive director of the  Miguel Augustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, perhaps the most highly respected human rights group in Mexico. The group focuses on the nation’s most serious cases of human rights abuses, making it a nettlesome critic of the government. In addition to Mr. Patrón, two other lawyers for the group were targeted with the software: Santiago Aguirre, the primary lawyer representing the families of the missing students, and Stephanie E. Brewer, a Harvard-educated American lawyer who has worked for the group since 2007. “We have always suspected they spied on us and listened to us,” Mr. Patrón said. “But to have evidence that we are victims of actual surveillance — it confirms that we are under threat. And that the government is willing to use illegal measures to try and stop us.” Beyond the missing students, Centro Prodh, as the group is called, is representing one of the few survivors of a military raid in 2014 in the town of Tlatlaya, where the army stormed a suspected cartel hide-out and killed 22 people. While pursuing the case, the group unearthed a memorandum ordering the soldiers to kill suspected cartel members, strengthening the argument that the events did not unfold as a firefight, as the military claimed, but were instead extrajudicial executions carried out by the soldiers. The organization’s clients also include the women of Atenco, a group of 11 university students, activists and market vendors who were arrested by the police more than 10 years ago during protests in the town of San Salvador Atenco and brutally sexually assaulted on the way to prison. Aside from the grave abuse of power, the case was especially sensitive: The governor who ordered the crackdown on the protesters was Enrique Peña Nieto, now the president of Mexico. From the very beginning, the case was an uphill battle. Arrested on trumped-up charges, some of the women spent more time in prison than the officers who raped them. Finding no recourse in Mexico, Ms. Brewer and others appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a regional body outside the Mexican judicial system, to review the case. And they waited — for nearly seven years. Finally, in 2015, the commission found in favor of the women, ordering the government to investigate the case all the way up the chain of command, a directive that would include Mr. Peña Nieto. Ultimately, the case was sent to the Inter-American Court, an independent judiciary with jurisdiction over Mexico, a major blow to the nation’s presidency. One evening Ms. Brewer was at home, getting ready for bed when a text message arrived. The date practically coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the assaults on the women, an eerie bookend to their decade-long struggle for justice. On her phone was a provocative question, a taunt even, asking whether anyone defended the soldiers and members of Mexico’s navy who also suffered abuse. “And you guys that do human rights against this, what about the dignity of them …” The message contained a link, presumably to a news story or a tip. Intrigued, Ms. Brewer clicked on it. She was directed to a broken link, a telltale sign of the malware. “It’s just part of defending human rights in Mexico,” she said. “It comes with the territory.”","MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted by advanced spyware sold to the Mexican government on the condition that it be used only to investigate criminals and terrorists. The targets include lawyers looking into the mass disappearance of 43 students, a highly respected academic who helped write anti-corruption legislation, two of Mexico’s most influential journalists and an American representing victims of sexual abuse by the police.","MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted by advanced spyware sold to the Mexican government on the condition that it be used only to investigate criminals and terrorists.

All were infected with Pegasus, which is made by Israel’s NSO Group, according to digital forensic experts working for them or their organizations. In one case, a journalist was notified recently that his phone had been hacked using the software; he received an email from Apple saying that someone might have gained access to data stored on his device after downloading what appeared to be a fake version of WhatsApp, the popular messaging app. It was unclear whether any information had actually been extracted during this episode. But all told, more than 10 people said they believed they had been infected at some point since last year, even though they did nothing wrong. “I feel like I am under surveillance,” said Carmen Aristegui, a well-known television anchorwoman whose cellphone number has long been publicly available through her show’s website. She learned about the potential breach when she saw news reports about how several other high-profile Mexicans had apparently also been hit. Her husband, David Ruiz Soto, a former editorial director at El Universal newspaper, got the same warning as Mr. Aristegui. “It makes me very nervous because we are living in a country where there is so much violence against journalism,” she added. A lawyer for Ms. Aristegui declined to comment. The revelations come amid growing concern over the use of technology by governments around the world to track dissidents and critics. Last month, Amnesty International reported that the United Arab Emirates had purchased the software from NSO, and that its agents had repeatedly attacked the phones of political opponents and others considered enemies of the state. Now, the list includes Mexico, which is widely regarded as having among Latin America’s worst records of press freedom and civil liberties violations. For years, President Enrique Peña Nieto has faced criticism over corrupt practices within his administration. He has vowed to crack down on crime and drug trafficking but has failed to make significant progress. His approval ratings remain low, and many Mexicans believe he is too close to business interests tied to organized crime. Mr. Peña Nieto has denied involvement in illegal wiretapping. And officials say the purchase of such tools does not necessarily mean that those being monitored are guilty of anything. Still, the revelations could further tarnish the president’s image and damage efforts to improve relations between the United States and Mexico. At least three of the cases involve Americans: Javier Sicilia, the founder of the Movement for Peace With Justice and Dignity, which advocated for peaceful solutions to the war on drugs; Lydia Cacho Ribeiro, a writer and women’s rights defender who fled Mexico after receiving death threats; and Kathryn Stone, an attorney based in Houston who represents families of people killed by the police in Tamaulipas State. Two of these cases involved attempts to get hold of information related to criminal investigations, including possible links between members of the Mexican military and cartels. One of the journalists, Miguel Ángel Bojorquez, wrote articles about allegedly shady real estate deals involving relatives of top security officials. Another journalist, Rafael Cabrera, focused on the disappearances of the Ayotzinapa teachers college students. Both men said they suspected they may have been spied upon before they began reporting on specific stories. They both said they were aware of the possibility that they would be watched, given the nature of their work. But neither knew they were being targeted until alerted by researchers hired by their employer, Proceso magazine. “We don’t know why our telephones were selected, but we do know that we were chosen,” Mr. Cabrera said. “The question now becomes, ‘How far will they go? What can they find out if they already have my messages and calls?’” Mr. Bojorquez said he felt betrayed by the federal government. “They want us to think that they care about transparency and democracy while they are doing things behind closed doors.” On Thursday evening, a group of academ ics, human rights activists and lawyers gathered outside the offices of the Attorney General’s Office in Mexico City to protest the apparent abuse of power. Some carried signs reading, “Stop Spying!” Others held up photos of the victims of recent killings by the authorities. Many expressed anger over the lack of accountability. “There needs to be justice here,” said Laura Zúñiga, executive director of Article 27, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting free expression online. “If you break the laws , there should be consequences.” The gathering was organized after reports surfaced that the Mexican government had been spying on journalists, activists and politicians — including those who were critical of President Enrique Peña Nieto or his administration. It is unclear how much information has actually been collected about these people; officials have denied any improper surveillance activities. But the revelations have added fuel to an already raging debate in this country: whether Mr. Peña Nieto’s administration can be trusted with its handling of sensitive personal data. In response to the controversies, he announced last weekend that he would create an independent commission to investigate allegations of illegal wiretapping under previous administrations. He also vowed to strengthen privacy protections for Mexicans. Yet critics say it will take more than new legislation to restore public confidence in the president and his party. They point out that Mr. Peña Nieto has yet to deliver on many promises made during his campaign two years ago, when he pledged to fight corruption and improve transparency. And they question why it took so long for him to address what some see as a major breach of civil liberties. “This shows us once again that we cannot rely on our institutions,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “We need to build mechanisms whereby citizens themselves are able to hold their governments accountable.” Last year, the United States Department of Justice disclosed that American agents working abroad sometimes intercept communications from foreign leaders without notifying them first, citing national security concerns. That news prompted widespread condemnation among Latin Americans, especially because of the region’s history of military dictatorships. Now, similar accusations against the Peña Nieto administration have emerged in Mexico, which has a troubled past involving disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions. Over the past few weeks, several local media organizations reported that the Federal Investigative Agency (AFI), part of the attorney general’s office, had monitored phone calls, e-mail messages and social network exchanges between journalists, activist groups, opposition political parties and others. The AFI did not respond to requests for comment. On Wednesday, however, Ricardo Mejía Domínguez, secretary of legal affairs within the attorney general’s office, acknowledged that the agency had conducted such operations but insisted they followed proper procedures. Among other things, he said, all monitoring was approved by judges beforehand. Still, many remain unconvinced. As Ms. Zúñiga pointed out, the fact that the court approvals came only recently suggests that the practice may have gone on longer than previously thought. Moreover, she noted, the courts rarely reject applications submitted by the federal prosecutor’s office. Other questions include exactly whom the AFI targeted, how often it operated and whether the agency ever tapped into conversations related to criminal investigations. So far, no one knows the answers to those queries. According to documents leaked earlier this month, the AFI used software called CIPAV, developed by Israel’s NSO Group, to collect mobile telephone numbers linked to specific users and then track their movements through cellular networks. While the company says its products allow clients to identify terrorism suspects, criminals and drug traffickers, the software apparently could also be employed to keep tabs on innocent civilians. This was demonstrated most dramatically in August, when Amnesty International obtained evidence showing that the Israeli firm had provided intelligence services in Egypt with tools capable of tracking down dissidents and human rights workers. One report showed that the technology helped police officers arrest Ahmed Abdullah Hussein Doma, a prominent blogger known as Sandmonkey, along with seven other members of the group April 6 Youth Movement. All eight men were detained for nearly three months until being released in November. Afterward, the bloggers accused the Egyptian government of using sophisticated digital espionage techniques to stifle freedom of speech."
"WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, resigned under pressure on Friday after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights and undermining President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp of a corrupt and entitled capital. Already in trouble with Mr. Trump for months of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care program, Mr. Price failed to defuse the president’s anger by offering regret and a partial reimbursement. His departure was the latest from an administration buffeted by turbulence at the top, and capped a week of setbacks for the president. “I’m not happy, O.K.?” Mr. Trump told reporters who asked about Mr. Price as the president prepared to leave for his New Jersey golf club for the weekend, barely an hour before the resignation was announced. “I can tell you, I’m not happy.” He called Mr. Price “a very good man” but added that the secretary’s offer to pay back the government for just part of the cost of the private flights “would be unacceptable.” Mr. Price ran afoul of one of the president’s most consequential campaign pledges. While some of Mr. Trump’s advisers privately make light of his vow to drain the swamp of Washington privilege, to many of his voters, it was a threshold promise. The firestorm over Mr. Price came as the president was already on the defensive with his base, as the incumbent mainstream Republican senator he backed in an Alabama primary race lost to an insurgent channeling Mr. Trump’s election movement. “It’s hard to see how a cabinet secretary can drain the swamp from 42,000 feet in the plush interior of a taxpayer-funded Gulfstream 4,” said Laura Ingraham, a conservative talk show host and Trump supporter who, like others, defied the president by backing Roy Moore, the insurgent Senate candidate who won in Alabama. Mr. Trump berated Mr. Price in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon for about two hours before heading out to meet with reporters, according to people informed about the meeting. All cabinet travel requests now must be cleared by the White House, they said. The White House’s announcement of Mr. Price’s departure was sparse, with none of the customary thanks for his service; it said simply that he had “offered his resignation earlier today and the president accepted.” In his resignation letter to Mr. Trump, Mr. Price said: “I have spent 40 years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first. I regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives. Success on these issues is more important than any one person. In order for you to move forward without further disruption, I am officially tendering my resignation.” Mr. Trump tapped Don J. Wright, a deputy assistant secretary for health and the director of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, to serve as acting secretary. Possible candidates for a successor include Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Price’s job was on the line since the first of a string of reports by Politico, on Sept. 19, about his extensive use of chartered aircraft. The president has fumed privately and publicly about Mr. Price’s actions. Hoping to assuage Mr. Trump, the secretary offered on Thursday to reimburse the government $51,887 — which he said represented the cost of his seat on the trips — of the at least $400,000 spent. But it was not enough to save his job. Mr. Price, a physician and a former Republican congressman from Georgia who had long opposed Mr. Obama’s Affordable Care Act, served as a point man on Mr. Trump’s drive to scrap the law. In July, Mr. Trump said he would fire Mr. Price if he did not get the votes for the legislation. “He better get them,” Mr. Trump told an audience with Mr. Price at his side. “Otherwise, I’ll say, ‘Tom, you’re fired.’” He said it in a jocular fashion, and his audience took it as a jest, but in fact the president has been privately simmering about Mr. Price over the unsuccessful efforts to pass health care legislation in the Senate. While a bill passed the House, the latest effort collapsed this week when enough Senate Republicans defected to deprive Mr. Trump of a majority. Mr. Price had been under fire from the start. During his confirmation hearing in January, Senate Democrats pressed him on the more than $100,000 in pharmaceutical and medical stocks he owned. Democrats said that Mr. Price had understated the value of his 400,613 shares in an Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics. He defended himself, saying, “Everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent.” In just eight months since taking office, Mr. Trump has fired or lost a chief of staff, a chief strategist, a national security adviser, a press secretary, two communications directors, a deputy chief of staff, a deputy national security adviser, the F.B.I. director and numerous other aides and advisers. Mr. Price may not be the only senior official to face anger over travel bills. In recent days, a slew of reports about the fast-lane habits of the cabinet have resulted in a mounting public relations headache for the Trump administration, which is stocked by billionaires accustomed to using private jets. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, used a chartered airplane for several flights, including a $12,000 trip to deliver a speech celebrating a new professional hockey team in Las Vegas. Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has spent more than $58,000 on chartered and military flights, and David Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary, took his wife on a 10-day trip to Europe that mixed business meetings and sightseeing, according to The Washington Post. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked about using a $25,000-an-hour military plane for his European honeymoon and later used a government jet to fly to Fort Knox in Kentucky in August, a trip that offered him a clear view of a solar eclipse, although he later disclaimed any interest. Other cabinet members issued statements explaining their travel practices. The Small Business Administration said its chief, Linda McMahon, had used private air services and that “on the rare occasion” she had, she “covered the entire cost out of her own pocket.” Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, travels on personally owned aircraft “at zero cost to U.S. taxpayers” because she “neither seeks, nor accepts, any reimbursement,” the department said. The sensitivity about the situation within the cabinet was clear on Friday when Mr. Zinke delivered an energy policy address to the Heritage Foundation. He opened his speech by lashing out at what he called “a little B.S.” on chartered flights. “I fly coach,” he said, adding that he uses chartered or military flights only when necessary. “Every time I travel, I submit the travel plans to the ethics department,” he added. “I will always be honest and up front about my travel.” Current and former West Wing officials said oversight of Mr. Trump’s cabinet was so lax in the past that Stephen K. Bannon, then the president’s chief strategist, requested meetings once every 60 days to review each member’s agenda and travel itinerary. The secretaries did not flag the questionable flights, the officials said. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who has tried to impose a military discipline on a chaotic West Wing with mixed success, has ordered the president’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, to revamp the review process for flights and set limits on prices that cabinet members can pay for transportation, according to two people briefed on the plans. At a recent meeting with legislative affairs aides for cabinet agencies, Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, warned that they should be prepared for additional reports on cabinet secretaries’ expenses, according to a person who attended. Mr. Short said that agencies should assume everything will be made public eventually — and urged the aides to come clean with the president’s staff first. Additionally, Rick Dearborn, a deputy White House chief of staff tasked with overseeing the cabinet, has been in the president’s cross hairs, according to an aide familiar with the situation. Mr. Dearborn accompanied Mr. Trump on his visit to Alabama last week to support Senator Luther Strange, who lost to Mr. Moore in the state’s Republican primary. On the flight back to Washington, the president lashed out at Mr. Dearborn and White House political director Bill Stepien because he was left supporting a candidate who seemed likely to lose, said the aide who was not authorized to be named. Two people on the plane insisted the president never chastised his aides. Another adviser said Mr. Dearborn and Mr. Stepien had both cautioned against the trip, but caught Mr. Trump’s wrath once it went badly. Critics were unmollified by Mr. Price’s departure. “While his resignation ends his time in the government, it does not end the private jet scandal that others in the Trump administration, including Mnuchin, Pruitt and Zinke, find themselves in,” Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a progressive watchdog group, said in a statement. “This administration,” he added, “seems to believe that the government and the taxpayers serve them rather than the other way around.” Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said the episode demonstrated a lack of judgment in the administration. “President Trump talked a big game about draining the swamp, yet he continues to surround himself with staff and administration officials who behave as though a separate set of rules apply to them,” he said. “That must end.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the events leading up to Secretary Price’s resignation. It was President Trump, not former President Barack Obama, who threatened to fire Mr. Price.","WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, resigned under pressure on Friday after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights and undermining President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp of a corrupt and entitled capital. Already in trouble with Mr. Trump for months of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care program, Mr. Price failed to defuse the president’s anger by offering regret and a partial reimbursement.","WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, resigned under pressure on Friday after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights and undermining President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp of a corrupt and entitled capital. Already in trouble with Mr. Trump for months of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care program, Mr. Price failed to defuse the president’s anger by offering regret and a partial reimbursement. of his expenses as he traveled around the country promoting Republican policies. Instead, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Price had “been very wrong” about his own conduct and accused him of having “totally destroyed” any chance of passing legislation overhauling insurance markets. The White House announced Mr. Price’s departure hours later without naming an interim replacement or saying when it would be filled permanently. In a statement, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Price, 62, who was confirmed last February despite some Democrats raising questions about his ethics during confirmation hearings because of stock trades made while serving as a member of Congress from Georgia. But the president added: “The Department of Health and Human Services is critical to keeping Americans safe and protecting their well-being.” He called Dr. Price “a valued adviser and friend,” adding, “His work on opioid abuse prevention has been particularly profound, helping people across this nation get into treatment and recover.” A few minutes earlier, Mr. Price issued a contrite letter to colleagues announcing his decision to step down. “I love my job and I am honored to serve in this administration,” wrote Mr. Price, who served briefly as a surgeon general before being promoted to lead H.H.S., which includes the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “But recently, articles have appeared that are distracting from our important mission at the agency.” His letter did not mention the scandal involving his use of private jets instead of commercial planes to visit medical centers and attend conferences. Nor did it address other complaints raised by lawmakers and watchdog groups about Mr. Price’s frequent trips abroad and how they were paid for. As part of its investigation, Politico reported Thursday night that the department spent more than $1 million flying Mr. Price alone since May 23. That included two international trips costing nearly half a million dollars each, one of them to Africa where Mr. Price visited Ebola patients. While the price tag may seem large compared with what most federal employees spend on airfare, it pales next to the amount spent on Air Force One, the presidential plane, which costs roughly $180,000 per hour to fly. And the total does not include thousands of additional taxpayer dollars spent shuttling Mr. Price between Washington and Atlanta so he could catch his flight home every weekend. Those costs came out of the same budget used to pay for many public health programs, including those focused on fighting addiction. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that he wanted Mr. Price gone but stopped short of demanding his ouster. By Friday afternoon, however, Mr. Trump seemed eager to move past the controversy surrounding Mr. Price, whom he appointed even though he knew little about him beyond his reputation as a conservative doctor. “We will begin searching for a new candidate forthwith,” Mr. Trump told reporters outside the Oval Office shortly before noon. “Obviously we want someone that loves the American people and wants to give back to America great health care.” It remained unclear whether Mr. Trump would appoint another cabinet official to temporarily fill Mr. Price’s position until a permanent successor can be found. If not, Mr. Trump might name a political appointee like Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, whose nomination stalled amid opposition from liberal senators concerned about her ties to Vice President Mike Pence and her role in Indiana’s expansion of Medicaid coverage. Ms. Verma, if nominated again, faces similar scrutiny from Democratic senators over her record running the state’s Medicaid system. Her critics say she cut benefits and imposed rules requiring recipients to seek prior approval for certain prescription drugs. She also drew criticism for her handling of a crisis related to the spread of H.I.V. among drug users injecting themselves illegally with fentanyl, heroin laced with fentanyl or carfentanil — all synthetic narcotics linked to hundreds of deaths. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking forward to finding a replacement who shares Mr. Price’s views on repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a less expensive alternative. They believe Mr. Price’s resignation will help clear the way for a vote on such proposals after months of setbacks and delays caused by internal divisions within the party. Still, there is reason for concern. Many Republicans remain skeptical about the GOP health care plan that was unveiled last month in Congress as an effort to replace President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. And the White House has not yet put forth its own detailed proposal, leaving many lawmakers unsure what they should support next. The uncertainty over whether Republicans can pass their legislation before the August recess may have contributed to Mr. Trump’s decision to fire his first secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, according to several people close to him. “I think he realized this isn’t going anywhere,” said one person briefed on the president’s thinking. On Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted: “The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on healthcare.” He added later: “Tom Price is a very good man & prominent Republican leader. He is also a highly respected medical expert. Same w/ Jim Mattis, General Kelly etc…..” A spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan confirmed late Thursday night that Mr. Price had submitted his letter of resignation at 8 p.m., but she declined further comment until the speaker received more details from the administration. In addition to being under pressure because of his stock trades while serving as HHS chief, Mr. Price faced opposition among some conservatives because he did not want to disrupt insurance markets created through the Affordable Care Act. Conservative groups like Heritage Action and FreedomWorks criticized Mr. Price’s efforts to stabilize those markets without undermining them entirely. But now, with Mr. Price gone, Mr. Trump could nominate someone willing to take a harder line against the law known as Obamacare. One name mentioned frequently is Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She would be able to use her agency to make changes to regulations governing the health care system that would circumvent congressional approval. Another possibility is Alex Azar II, a former executive vice president at Eli Lilly and Company whose wife, Susan DeVore, led the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation during the Obama years. Both Ms. Verma and Mr. Azar were considered possible replacements when Mr. Price came into office. While Mr. Price was well liked personally, he clashed repeatedly with Mr. Trump, especially over how best to move ahead on health policy. As recently as Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Mr. Price, saying in a Twitter post that “ObamaCare premiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare!” The president then turned his attention to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, asking why he hadn’t passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. It wasn’t immediately clear if Mr. Trump knew of Mr. Price’s plans to step down. After Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as FBI director earlier this year, he learned only afterward that Mr. Comey planned to announce publicly that he was stepping aside. By contrast, Mr. Price told colleagues privately that he intended to leave soon, giving them time to prepare for a leadership change. Mr. Price’s departure leaves two vacant Cabinet positions remaining: interior secretary and agriculture secretary. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced her retirement just hours ago; Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is expected to stay in place for six weeks longer than originally scheduled. Several other cabinet secretaries have left since January, including Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and Veterans Affairs Secretary David J. Shulkin. At least three others have been nominated to fill openings, though none has been formally approved. Some Democrats saw Mr. Price’s departure as another sign of chaos inside the West Wing."
"• Bruno Mars swept the top categories, winning album, record and song of the year. • Our writers and critics weigh in on the best and worst moments of the Grammys. • Kendrick Lamar won five awards. Alessia Cara won best new artist. • See all the winners and the red carpet looks. • The music industry acknowledged #MeToo during the ceremony and on the red carpet. The 60th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday gave its highest accolades to Bruno Mars, an upbeat master of danceable pop, even as the show wrestled with a range of social and political topics including immigration, race and the #MeToo movement. Mr. Mars won all six of the awards he was nominated for, including the top prizes of album, record and song of the year. The next most rewarded artist was Kendrick Lamar, the provocative and critically admired rapper from Compton, Calif., whose five wins included a sweep of the rap categories. Their victories came at the expense of Jay-Z, now a reigning elder of hip-hop and the music business in general, who had arrived as the most-nominated artist of the night, with eight nods, but went home empty-handed. The show at Madison Square Garden also featured the Grammys’ much-anticipated response to the #MeToo movement. While the reckoning over harassment and gender equality has swept over Hollywood, media and politics, its effect on the music industry had been minimal, leading to scrutiny over how the show would address the issue. But a call-to-arms by Janelle Monáe, and an emotional performance by Kesha, approached it head-on. “You see, it’s not just going on in Hollywood, it’s not just going on in Washington,” Ms. Monáe said. “It’s right here in our industry as well.” “And just as we have the power to shape culture,” she added, “we also have the power to undo a culture that does not serve us well.” Mr. Mars, who has earned the respect of the industry as an all-around entertainer, capable of repeatedly scaling the pop charts and entertaining the nation at the Super Bowl, won album of the year for “24K Magic,” as well as record of the year for the title track and song of the year — a songwriters’ award — for “That’s What I Like.” (His album also claimed an engineering prize.) Song of the year went to Mr. Mars and the seven other writers of “That’s What I Like,” a slice of 1980s-throwback funk. Accepting the award, Mr. Mars was surrounded by what looked like an entourage, but they were the credited writers of the song, reflecting the new production model of pop music in which huge teams of specialized writers collaborate. “I’ve been knowing these guys for over a decade,” Mr. Mars said. “All the music-business horror stories you’ve seen in the movies, we’ve been through all of them.” “It’s an honor to share this with you all tonight,” he told them. In addition to Mr. Mars, they were Christopher Brody Brown, James Fauntleroy, Philip Lawrence, and the quartet known as the Stereotypes: Ray Charles McCullough II, Jeremy Reeves, Ray Romulus and Jonathan Yip. In the days leading up the awards, the Grammys faced questions how the show — and the music industry at large — would respond to the #MeToo movement and the show of solidarity at the Golden Globes this month, when the women of Hollywood, wearing black, presented a united front. In a forceful speech, Ms. Monáe spoke for the women of the music industry, calling for a unified response of the women in music against sexism and sexual harassment, saying, “We come in peace but we mean business.” Then Kesha sang “Praying,” her ballad of anger and redemption, surrounded by women all in white, including the singers Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Julia Michaels and Andra Day and the Resistance Revival Chorus, a collective of women who sing protest songs. Kesha became pop’s symbol of the fight against sexual assault when, in a 2014 lawsuit, she accused her producer, Dr. Luke, of inflicting years of abuse. (Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, in turn accused Kesha of fabricating the story in an attempt to escape her recording contracts.) Her voice breaking, Kesha sang “You brought the flames and you put me through hell,” and “When I’m finished, they won’t even know your name.” As she finished, she held back tears and the choir gathered around her in a group embrace. Immediately afterward, Ms. Cabello, a young Cuban-Amerian singer who had been part of Kesha’s performance, introduced a segment highlighting immigration, with the cameras turning to a view of the Statue of Liberty and Emma Lazarus’s poem “The New Colossus” (“Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”). Then U2 performed its song “Get Out of Your Own Way” on a barge in New York harbor. (The performance had been taped two nights before.) [ Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder. ] The 60th annual Grammy Awards opened with a striking conceptual performance by Kendrick Lamar and by Bono and the Edge of U2, with Dave Chappelle serving as a one-man Greek chorus. It walked a fine line between confrontational political commentary and grounding comedy. Mr. Lamar began surrounded by phalanxes of soldiers in camouflage fatigues as he began his song “XXX” with images of the American flag waving behind him on digital screens. After the words “This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar” flashed behind him, and a brief appearance by Bono and the Edge, the camera cut to Mr. Chappelle, who said: “The only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America.” The show then alternated again between Mr. Lamar and Mr. Chappelle, before ending with Mr. Lamar standing among men in red hoodies who were gunned down one by one. Lady Gaga then took the stage to sing her ballads “Joanne” and “Million Reasons” at a white piano draped with the wings of a bird or an angel. “Time’s up,” she said. Mr. Lamar next won the first prize of the night, for best rap/sung performance, for “LOYALTY.,” featuring Rihanna, who told him: “Congrats. You deserve this, man.” Accepting the award for best rap album for “DAMN.,” Mr. Lamar delivered a paean to hip-hop itself, which, he said, had “showed me the true definition of what an artist was.” “From the jump I thought it was about the accolades, and the cars and the clothes,” Mr. Lamar said. “But it’s really about expressing yourself, putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that.” Then he paid tribute to his artistic heroes, including Jay-Z, Nas and Puff Daddy, and added, as the ultimate obeisance: “Jay for president.” There were other notable performances. Dressed in a glowing white suit, Childish Gambino — the musical persona of Donald Glover, who has won Golden Globes and Emmys as an actor — performed “Terrified” as a slithery erotic fantasy fully of falsetto and a gentle funk groove. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee played their monster Latin pop hit “Despacito,” surrounded by grinding couples, the women in ultrashort shorts or nude-colored showgirl get-ups. Rihanna sang “Wild Thoughts” with Bryson Tiller and DJ Khaled, fully in character as a big-voiced hype man. Elton John played his “Tiny Dancer” with Miley Cyrus. And Sting, strangely ubiquitous in the show, played his 1987 song “Englishman in New York” as a Police-style smooth groove. Alessia Cara, a 21-year-old Canadian pop singer who has songs of empowerment like “Scars to Your Beautiful,” took home one of the ceremony’s big four awards. After the microphone was lowered reach her, Ms. Cara said: “Holy cow, I’m shaking. I’ve been pretend-winning Grammys since I was a kid, like in my shower.” All but nine of the 84 awards were given out at a nontelevised ceremony in the afternoon. During the preshow ceremony, Mr. Lamar won best rap performance, best rap song and best music video, all for “HUMBLE.” Mr. Mars won best R&B performance and R&B song for “That’s What I Like,” and best R&B album for “24K Magic.” Despite 21 past wins, Jay-Z has never taken home a Grammy in the top categories, and that did not change at Sunday’s ceremony. The rapper, who was feted as an “industry icon” at Clive Davis’s glittery annual pre-Grammy party, was shut out. Ed Sheeran, who was snubbed in the top categories, was awarded best pop vocal album, in absentia, for “÷,” one of last year’s biggest hits. He also won best pop solo performance for “Shape of You.” Childish Gambino won best traditional R&B performance for his song “Redbone,” a 1970s funk throwback that was a surprise hit at radio last year. The country singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton won two awards in the preshow ceremony: best country solo performance for “Either Way,” and best country song for “Broken Halos,” which Mr. Stapleton wrote with Mike Henderson. Jason Isbell also won two: best Americana album, for “The Nashville Sound,” and best American roots song, for “If We Were Vampires.” Carrie Fisher won a posthumous Grammy — her first — in the best spoken word album category, for “The Princess Diarist.” After Mr. Stapleton won best country album for “From A Room: Volume 1,” the country singers Eric Church, Maren Morris and the Brothers Osborne offered a tribute to the victims of violence at music events. Ms. Morris began the introduction drawing a connection between the bombing in Manchester, England, last May and the shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas in October. “All country music was reminded in the most tragic way,” Mr. Church said, the connection we share with our fans and the healing power of music will always provide.” As they played a quiet and stripped-down version of Eric Clapton’s “Tears in Heaven,” the names of individual victims were displayed on glowing panels behind them, as if electronic votive candles. The Grammys, like most awards shows, have been wrestling for years with issues of diversity: ethnic, gender and, in the Grammys’ case, musical. Not so long ago, the show drew eye rolls for over-rewarding elder heroes at the expense of pop’s younger, more vital mainstream. (Think Ray Charles beating Green Day and Kanye West in 2005, or Herbie Hancock defeating Amy Winehouse and, ahem, Mr. West in 2008.) The Grammys have generally gotten much better at recognizing the pulse of contemporary music. A diverse crop of nominees this year made it likely that the winners of the four most prestigious categories — album, record and song of the year, and best new artist — would not be white men. At the same time, gender remained very much still an issue. Lorde was the only woman up for album of the year; she did not perform at the ceremony. Julia Michaels and Ms. Cara have credits in the song of the year category (which recognizes songwriters). Otherwise, the top nominees were predominantly male. As a new report indicated, gender diversity at the Grammys — and in the music industry at large — has been abysmal. As the Grammys approached, it became clear that aside from the performance by Kesha, the industry had no organized response to the #MeToo movement planned along the lines of the Time’s Up campaign that was front and center at the recent Golden Globes. That changed just days ago, when a small group of midlevel female music executives called for artists to wear a white rose to the show, as a sign of “hope, peace, sympathy and resistance.” By Thursday, a handful of stars including Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson had pledged their support. On Sunday, the group circulated a list of music-industry professionals and artists who had signed on to the effort, adding Pink, Dua Lipa and Lil Uzi Vert, among others. At the preshow ceremony, several artists wore white roses, although their comments about it were muted. Reba McEntire, the country star, was asked about the white rose on her dress after she won best roots gospel album for “Sing It Now: Songs of Faith & Hope.” “My message is, I want to treat you like I want to be treated,” Ms. McEntire said. “It’s the golden rule. I think if we did that more often, a lot of these problems would be nonexistent. Let’s just treat people kindly.” Lisa Loeb, who won best children’s album, said, only half in jest: “I know some people are saying the music industry took a little while to catch up with some of the other industries. But we haven’t had as many awards ceremonies.” Hours before the show began, it already had a Trump controversy. On Saturday night, CNN aired an interview with Jay-Z as part of the inaugural episode of “The Van Jones Show,” in which Jay-Z commented on the president’s reported denigration of Haiti and African countries. “It is disappointing and it’s hurtful,” Jay-Z said. “Because it’s looking down at a whole population of people and it’s so misinformed because these places have beautiful people and beautiful everything. This is the leader of the free world speaking like this.” By 8:18 a.m. Sunday, the president fired off his response on Twitter. A little more than an hour later, Mr. Jones — who is managed by Jay-Z’s company, Roc Nation — wrote on Twitter in response, noting that he did ask Jay-Z about the president’s record on reducing black unemployment, and Jay-Z responded that the issue was about treating people with respect and not, as he put it: “Treat me really bad and pay me well.” Some of the stars at the preshow ceremony seized the opportunity to make political or personal statements. Residente, a Puerto Rican rapper who founded the influential group Calle 13, won best Latin rock album (for “Residente”). Dedicating his prize “to my country, Puerto Rico,” he spoke about the need to seek out reliable sources of news about the island. “What’s happening in Puerto Rico is horrible,” he said. “We’ve been without electricity for six months now. Some people are dying because they are not eating well. All of that, I had it in my heart when I won this a moment ago.” Cécile McLorin Salvant, a Haitian-American singer who won best jazz vocal album, addressed President Trump’s comments about Haiti and Africa. “At some points you have to either laugh or cry,” she said. “I choose to laugh.” The political material was also played for laughs. In one segment, Mr. Corden had celebrities audition for the job of reading the audiobook of Michael Wolff’s “Fire & Fury,” the much talked about look inside the Trump White House. John Legend, Cher, Snoop Dogg and Cardi B — a Bronx-born former stripper who has instantly become one of the music industry’s most beloved figures — all incredulously read excerpts aloud. The winning reader turned out to be Hillary Clinton. The bit drew laughs throughout the arena, but not everyone was pleased. “I have always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it,” Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter. “Don’t ruin great music with trash. Some of us love music without the politics thrown in it.” For a year that saw the losses of Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Tom Petty, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, Malcolm Young of AC/DC and Walter Becker of Steely Dan, there were several tributes. After the annual “in memoriam” montage, the rapper Logic, in a hoodie with “You are not alone” on the back, performed his “1-800-273-8255,” whose title is the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. As on the recording, he was joined by Ms. Cara and Khalid. Some also happened out of sight of the cameras. After a 40th anniversary edition of the Voyager Golden Record — the gold discs sent into space containing the sounds of the earth, including Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode” — won best box set package, Lawrence Azerrad, one of the album’s art directors, commented on the everlasting life of Berry’s music. “Long after the earth is gone, swallowed up by the sun,” he said, “Chuck Berry’s record will still be floating in space.” While many stars will pack the stage, the Grammys were also notable for who wasn’t there. Besides Mr. Sheeran, neither Taylor Swift nor Justin Bieber were in attendance. Jay-Z and Lorde were in the audience but did not perform. Scheduling, limitations of time and space, and the whims of performers and producers may well account for many of these absences. But in recent years, the Grammys have also faced boycotts from some artists who feel that not enough of the top prizes go to black artists. Frank Ocean stated that in regards to last year’s show. And while Drake has said that the reason he is not performing is that the Grammys asked him to cancel one of his own shows to appear, he also did not submit his latest “playlist” album, “More Life,” for award consideration. The Grammys were being held in New York for the first time since 2003, when the city was still struggling to attract business and tourism after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The New York mayor’s office lobbied hard to bring the awards back. But aside from a handful of segments with heavy-handed New York themes, the broadcast seemed little different from its recent ones at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. In one, James Corden, the host, brought Sting and the reggae singer Shaggy into the subway for a vaudevillian version of Mr. Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke,” with tough New Yorkers telling the three men to shut up or, after taking out earbuds, waving them away with “Sorry, I don’t have any cash on me.” Bruno Mars and Cardi B sang Mr. Mars’s “Finesse” as a costumed nod to 1980s hip-hop, with b-boy outfits and moves that seemed pulled from the Rosie Perez book of choreography. Later in the show was a reverent tribute to the musical traditions of Broadway, with Ben Platt from “Dear Evan Hansen” singing Leonard Bernstein’s “Somewhere” from “West Side Story,” accompanied on a dark platform by cello and acoustic guitar, his voice filling Madison Square Garden at the song’s climax. (Earlier in the day, “Dear Evan Hansen” won best musical theater album.) And Patti LuPone, backed up by an orchestra and with a full set behind her, sang “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina” from “Evita,” a reprise of her performance from the Grammys in 1981, when that show won best cast show album.","• Bruno Mars swept the top categories, winning album, record and song of the year. • Our writers and critics weigh in on the best and worst moments of the Grammys.","• Bruno Mars swept the top categories, winning album, record and song of the year. • Our writers and critics weigh in on the best and worst moments of the Grammys. . • Read more about this year’s Grammy Awards here. The Grammys were a night for old-school music to shine — but not always as expected. In an awards show that seemed at times like it was trying too hard to be “relevant,” many of its biggest winners had little or no connection with contemporary pop culture. And when they did connect, it wasn’t necessarily how you might have predicted: For example, Adele won three trophies Sunday evening (including one for her new single, “Hello”), while Beyoncé went home empty handed after being nominated six times. Still, there were plenty of memorable performances by artists who are very much part of today’s musical landscape. One such artist is Rihanna, whose performance of “Kiss It Better” from her latest No. 1 hit album, “Anti,” showed off both her vocal prowess and her sartorial style. But perhaps most surprisingly, she also brought out a guest star: Drake, who performed his own recent chart-topper, “Hotline Bling.” Other highlights included Kendrick Lamar’s fiery rendition of “The Blacker the Berry”; Lady Gaga’s emotional tribute to David Bowie; and Justin Timberlake’s high-energy medley of hits spanning two decades. Here are some other takeaways from the ceremony, which took place live from Los Angeles and was hosted by James Corden. Best New Artist Nominees Were All Over the Map This category has been a reliable source of controversial snubs over the years. Last time around, the Recording Academy left off Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and Iggy Azalea despite their popularity among fans and industry insiders alike. This year, the nomination committee didn’t disappoint. Instead of selecting an obvious frontrunner like Meghan Trainor, who dominated airplay charts last summer, the group chose five acts who all have something different going for them: Tori Kelly, Courtney Barnett, James Bay, Sam Hunt and Meg Mac. Mr. Corden even tried to make light of the situation during his opening monologue, saying he wanted to give each performer equal stage time because “we don’t want any of these kids coming back next year complaining about how they got screwed.” Alas, the joke fell flat. Ms. Kelly ended up taking home the award, but only after losing to Ms. McCallum in the first round of voting. (Ms. Kelly later returned to accept the honor.) At least the winner had a great speech prepared if she hadn’t taken home the prize. After thanking God, her family and friends, she said, “I just want to say I love my parents so much for believing in me.” Then she added: “This is so crazy! My mom used to tell me growing up ‘You can do anything.’ So, mama, look what I did!” Taylor Swift Fell Short Again Even though she made history earlier this month by becoming the youngest person ever to win Album of the Year twice, Miss Swift still couldn’t get enough recognition from the Recording Academy. Her critically acclaimed release, “1989,” failed to earn nominations in four major categories — including Record of the Year and Song of the Year — despite generating several radio smashes and reaching platinum status within weeks of its release. Perhaps the Recording Academy should consider giving her another shot? Or maybe it will go ahead and hand the title to someone else entirely. That happened once before, when Eminem became the first hip-hop act to receive the big prize in 2000. He lost again the following year. Bruno Mars Was King of Pop While the Grammys often feel like a battle between rap and rock, this year’s honoree for the prestigious Producer of the Year Award was decidedly uncontroversial. Mark Ronson beat out Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Jeff Bhasker and Sham Pooja to claim the honor, thanks largely to his work with Mr. Mars, who released two albums in 2015 alone. Mr. Mars’s triumphant return to the spotlight began with “Uptown Funk,” a collaboration with Mr. Ronson and producer Nicky Romero. Released late last fall, the track quickly climbed Billboard’s Hot 100 list, eventually peaking at No. 3 on the singles chart. Later came “Golden Skies,” a solo song featuring Miguel that reached No. 46 on the same ranking. in May of last year, and “The Hills (From Where You Are),” which hit No. 50 when it was released as part of her soundtrack for the movie The Twilight Saga: New Moon in November. Ms. Perry’s latest single is “Wildfire.” Her album has not been announced yet; she said only that its release would be timed with the tour dates. She will also perform songs from her other projects — including the 2010 film Eat Pray Love, based on Elizabeth Gilbert’s memoir about traveling to Italy, India and Indonesia after getting divorced — during the shows. In an interview, Ms. Perry described herself as someone who had always felt more comfortable performing than recording music. But even though she has spent much time in studios over the years working on albums like Teenage Dream, her most recent full-length effort, Prism, did not come together until recently. “I feel very lucky because I have this opportunity now where I can do both things,” she said. “And they are so different. They require two totally separate skill sets. So if you love one thing but hate doing another, then maybe it’s just not your path.” Ms. Perry began writing material for what became Prism while making the video for “Roar,” the first single off the album. That song, which features a chorus of roaring lions, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 list in September. It remained there for four weeks before being displaced by Pharrell Williams’s ubiquitous “Happy.” In October, Ms. Perry performed “Roar” at the American Music Awards, where she won favorite pop/rock female artist. Last weekend, she sang the song again at the Grammy Nominations Concert Live! special broadcast on CBS. On Tuesday night, she appeared alongside Mr. Williams at the MusiCares Person of the Year gala honoring Bruce Springsteen, singing his classic “Dancing in the Dark.” When asked why she chose to sing such a well known tune rather than one of hers, Ms. Perry laughed and explained that Mr. Springsteen had written the song specifically for her performance. “He wrote me into ‘Dark,’ ” she said. “That’s how he wanted us to end our set tonight.” Ms. Perry, whose parents were born in Australia, grew up listening to Australian rock bands like AC/DC and Cold Chisel. After moving to Los Angeles from Melbourne at age 17, she studied acting under Stella Adler and started taking voice lessons. By the early 2000s, she had begun releasing dance records through labels owned by L.A. Reid, the former chairman of Epic Records and current executive vice president of Island Def Jam Music Group. Among those releases were the single “Lionheart” and her debut studio album, One of the Boys, which featured collaborators like Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. A decade later, Ms. Perry remains best known for her work outside the realm of traditional pop music. But she does not consider herself a genre-defying artist. Rather, she says, she likes to think of herself as simply a singer. And right now, she wants nothing more than to share her newfound vocal skills live. “I’ve never really done any kind of concert tour or anything like that,” she said. “So my goal is to make sure people get to see all these parts of myself that haven’t necessarily gotten out there yet. Because we don’t know each other."
"A jury in San Diego on Thursday rejected claims by a law graduate, Anna Alaburda, that the Thomas Jefferson School of Law enticed her to enroll by using misleading graduate employment figures. In the first — and perhaps last — such case to reach the courtroom, Ms. Alaburda, 37, argued that the school reported a higher percentage of its graduates landed jobs after graduation than was actually the case, and that she relied on the bogus data to choose to attend the school. After amassing more than $150,000 in debt to graduate in 2008, she has been unable to find a full-time, salaried job as a lawyer, she says. A jury voted nine to three to reject her claims. Still, unlike more than a dozen other disgruntled lawyers who have tried but failed to bring their former law schools to trial for counting their graduates’ post-degree jobs such as waitresses and bartenders as full-time legal employment, Ms. Alaburda survived attempts over the past five years to sink her case. Thomas Jefferson stood by its employment figures. Its lawyer, Michael Sullivan, argued that earning a law degree was not a guarantee of a well-paying job. “I’m not here to tell you a law degree is a guarantee of career success, is a guarantee of riches,” Mr. Sullivan told the jury. “It’s not. No degree is.” At trial in San Diego Superior Court this month, Ms. Alaburda said she chose Thomas Jefferson after consulting popular law school guides, including the 2004 edition of best graduate schools by U.S. News & World Report. The San Diego school’s listing said that just over 80 percent of its graduates were employed nine months after they graduated. “I knew it wasn’t as competitive as first- or second-tier law schools, but it still had pretty decent statistics and was A.B.A. accredited,” she told the jury. “So I thought it was a pretty decent school to apply to.” Other law school graduates, citing six-figure debt and misleading employment data, have tried to hold law schools around the country accountable. About 15 such lawsuits were derailed before they reached a jury. Ms. Alaburda, who invoked California state fraud protections, was the first to get her case before a jury even though a judge earlier rejected her effort to certify her claim as a class-action lawsuit, with potentially high-dollar damage awards. Ms. Alaburda, who has worked in a series of part-time legal support jobs, asked for $125,000 for lost wages and reimbursement of tuition and fees. Entry-level legal jobs began shrinking after the 2008 economic slowdown, and law graduates were left saddled with six-figure debt loads and limited job prospects. Since then, the American Bar Association has been taking steps to require law schools to be more open about postgraduate job placement. While the 200-plus accredited law schools must now publish a more detailed breakdown of their employment data, including whether jobs are full time or part time, critics said the jury’s decision lets schools off the hook. “At the time, law schools systematically deceived students with misleading statistics, with the blessing of the American Bar Association,” said Kyle McEntee, executive director of Law School Transparency, a nonprofit that campaigns to hold law schools accountable. The jury was asked to decide whether the school intentionally misrepresented the employment statistics or was simply negligent. Brian A. Procel, Ms. Alaburda’s lawyer, said the school did not reveal that its employment figures included such work as a pool cleaner, waitress or sales clerk, and that they were based on a small sample of graduates. Thomas Jefferson employees maintained that they did not understand the importance of the employment data, and that the school was a nonprofit institution offering opportunities to students who might not have other options to attend law school. Mr. Procel said those assertions were contradicted by correspondence indicating that law school employees knew that the graduate employment figures affected the law school’s national ranking — which, in turn, helped burnish the school’s credibility and draw more students to enroll. Judges in Illinois, Michigan and New York, where similar cases were filed, have generally concluded that law students opted for legal education at their own peril and were sophisticated enough to have known that employment as a lawyer was not guaranteed. A lawsuit against Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco was settled last year, with five graduates being awarded about $8,000 each. Thomas Guernsey, the dean of Thomas Jefferson, said, “Today’s decision by the jury further validates our unwavering commitment to providing our students with the knowledge, skills and tools necessary to excel as law students, pass the bar exam and succeed in their professional careers.” Mr. Procel said he hoped the case would help ensure that future students “have access to better information when deciding to attend college or graduate school.” Ms. Alaburda declined to comment.","A jury in San Diego on Thursday rejected claims by a law graduate, Anna Alaburda, that the Thomas Jefferson School of Law enticed her to enroll by using misleading graduate employment figures.

The verdict came as other schools are facing similar accusations from former students who say they were duped into paying tuition for degrees that did not prepare them well enough for careers or adequately help them repay their student loans. But this is believed to be only the second time any legal dispute involving false job placement statistics has gone before jurors; most cases have been settled out of court. “I’m relieved,” said Jeffrey L. Thomas, an attorney representing TJSL against Ms. Alaburda. He added: “We believe there will be more litigation.” Mr. Thomas declined to comment further because he had signed a confidentiality agreement. Ms. Alaburda, whose name is also spelled Alaburdha, represented herself during much of the trial but hired two lawyers at key points when the judge decided it would be appropriate. She told jurors that she attended TJSL between 2015 and 2018, borrowing $94,674 through federal financial aid programs to do so. After graduating cum laude, she passed the California bar examination in February 2018. That same month, however, she began working part-time for less money than she made while studying full time at TJLS. Her goal now is to get back all the money she spent going to law school. According to the National Association for Law Placement, which collects information about postgraduate employment rates among American law schools, the average rate for TJSL’s class of 2018 was just under 60 percent. By comparison, the national figure for private institutions like TJLS is around 66 percent. For public universities, including state colleges, the rate averages nearly 75 percent. During closing arguments Wednesday morning, Judge Michael D. Libensky reminded jurors that they must decide whether the allegedly inflated numbers caused Ms. Alaburda harm. If they find no damage, then the claim fails. “If you don’t think anything happened here, I can tell you right away what your answer should be,” he said. Juror No. 2, a woman named Kathleen, asked if she could take notes during deliberations. When the judge said yes, Kathleen pulled out a small spiral pad and started writing down questions. At one point, another juror, a man identified only as John, suggested that the questionnaire sent to prospective students might contain some of the answers needed. “It doesn’t matter how many times we read it,” he said. “They never answered those questions directly.” On Monday afternoon, Ms. Alaburda took the stand and testified that she wanted to become a lawyer since childhood. She graduated magna cum laude from Stony Brook University in New York in 2008 with a degree in psychology. She worked briefly as a paralegal assistant before deciding to go to law school. She applied to five different schools, including Harvard, Columbia and Georgetown Universities. While applying to these top-ranked schools, she received emails from admissions officers at TJLS assuring her that the school was committed to helping her succeed academically and financially once admitted. “The email I got from them sounded very personalized,” she said. “This really felt like my dream school.” She chose TJLS based partly on the fact that it offered scholarships up front rather than waiting until later in the admission process. It also promised to give her access to alumni mentoring opportunities. Ultimately, she paid $17,000 per year for three years, totaling almost $51,000. She ended up taking out roughly $94,000 worth of student loan debts, according to testimony. In addition to being ranked near the bottom of law schools nationwide, TJLS has faced numerous complaints in recent months about poor academic performance and high levels of stress. Last week, the United States Department of Education announced plans to investigate the school following reports by several news organizations. Among other things, the department may look into claims that TJSL misrepresented its job placement data. A representative for the university declined to comment on the case. Throughout the trial, the defense argued that the school does not guarantee jobs upon graduation. Rather, it offers career services assistance — such as resume reviews and interview preparation — to anyone who asks. They noted that Ms. Alaburda did not avail herself of these resources after graduation. “She didn’t even ask for help,” said Mr. McNamara in his closing arguments. But Ms. Alaburda testified during her deposition that she was never informed about the resources available at the law school or how they could be accessed. She also claimed that a counselor told her there were no full-time positions open at the time she graduated. The judge is expected to issue a ruling within 60 days.
The post Law School Graduate Sues Over Job Placement Claims appeared first on New York Times. . WASHINGTON — President Trump’s decision to replace the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, with John F. Kelley was an extraordinary act that underscored how much power Mr. Trump has concentrated in his own hands and how little he trusts those around him. The move came after a tumultuous week for the administration during which Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had been publicly criticized by some senior officials; Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced into recusing himself from any investigations involving Russia because of his contacts with Russian diplomats before taking office; and Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort surrendered to federal authorities on charges related to money laundering and tax fraud. On Monday morning, Mr. Kelly, who is known as “the general,” arrived at the West Wing wearing camouflage fatigues and carrying a duffel bag full of clothes and personal items. He met briefly with the president in the Oval Office but did not stay long enough to meet other top advisers or Cabinet members. Instead, he went straight upstairs to see Mr. Priebus, whom he replaced. Aides said they were told only minutes earlier that Mr. Priebus would be fired. In a statement announcing Mr. Priebus’ departure, Mr. Trump praised him as having done a great job but made no mention of Mr. Kelly, whose appointment he announced just hours later. By late afternoon, Mr. Priebus had left the building through a side door and gone home without saying goodbye to colleagues. But Mr. Kelly, 67, a retired Marine Corps four-star general who served two tours of duty in Iraq, quickly moved into place. After meeting privately with the president, he began making phone calls to key players like Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and majority leader, asking them to give their support. And then, within hours, he held a news conference where he pledged loyalty to the president and promised to restore order to the chaotic West Wing. It was clear early on Tuesday that the changeover was going smoothly: Mr. Kelly was seen entering the White House residence to greet Mrs. Trump and her daughter Ivanka Trump, who are both there while their father is away in Europe. Mr. Kelly also spoke warmly about the first lady, telling reporters she had helped make the transition easier than it might have otherwise been. As he took over as chief of staff, Mr. Kelly became one of the most powerful people in Washington. His new role will put him in charge of all aspects of running the executive branch, including setting priorities among competing demands. He will work closely with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who now serves as a kind of shadow chief of staff, along with Stephen Miller, another close confidant of the president. Both men will report directly to Mr. Kelly. While Mr. Kelly may try to impose more discipline inside the White House, he could face resistance from allies of Mr. Priebus, many of whom remain in important positions, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Some of these officials have already expressed reservations about Mr. Trump’s recent actions, such as firing off Twitter messages attacking lawmakers. Still, Mr. Kelly is expected to be welcomed by Republicans eager to contain the damage caused by Mr. Priebus’ failure to assert control over a mercurial boss. One reason for optimism is that Mr. Kelly shares Mr. Trump’s instinctive dislike of leaks and believes strongly in keeping secrets. That trait should help keep information flowing between the West Wing and Capitol Hill when Congress returns next month. Mr. Kelly will also bring military experience that can help guide Mr. Trump toward decisions on matters like North Korea and Afghanistan, where he has shown interest in sending additional troops. But he faces challenges of his own. Mr. Kelly has never worked in government before and must learn the ropes fast if he hopes to prevent further embarrassments. If he does not succeed, Mr. Trump’s presidency could suffer even greater damage. For now, though, Mr. Trump seems pleased with the outcome. He tweeted Wednesday night: “General John Kelly is doing a fantastic job as Chief of Staff. Greatest assets @WhiteHouse! #MAGA.” The choice of Mr. Kelly surprised many observers since he seemed unlikely to get past the vetting process given his lack of political experience. But Mr."
"WASHINGTON — A Senate security officer stepped out of the December chill last year and delivered envelopes marked “Top Secret” to the Pentagon, the C.I.A., the State Department and the Justice Department. Inside each packet was a disc containing a 6,700-page classified report on the C.I.A.’s secret prison program and a letter from Senator Dianne Feinstein, urging officials to read the report to ensure that the lessons were not lost to time. Today, those discs sit untouched in vaults across Washington, still in their original envelopes. The F.B.I. has not retrieved a copy held for it in the Justice Department’s safe. State Department officials, who locked up their copy and marked it “Congressional Record — Do Not Open, Do Not Access” as soon as it arrived, have not read it either. Nearly a year after the Senate released a declassified 500-page summary of the report, the fate of the entire document remains in limbo, the subject of battles in the courts and in Congress. Until those disputes are resolved, the Justice Department has prohibited officials from the government agencies that possess it from even opening the report, effectively keeping the people in charge of America’s counterterrorism future from reading about its past. There is also the possibility that the documents could remain locked in a Senate vault for good. In a letter to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch last week, Ms. Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the Justice Department was preventing the government from “learning from the mistakes of the past to ensure that they are not repeated.” Although Ms. Feinstein is eager to see the document circulated, the Senate is now under Republican control. Her successor as head of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, has demanded that the Obama administration return every copy of the report. Mr. Burr has declared the report to be nothing more than “a footnote in history.” It was always clear that the full report would remain shielded from public view for years, if not decades. But Mr. Burr’s demand, which means that even officials with top security clearances might never read it, has reminded some officials of the final scene of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” when the Ark of the Covenant is put into a wooden crate alongside thousands of others in a government warehouse of secrets. The report tells the story of how, in the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the C.I.A. began capturing people and interrogating them in secret prisons beyond the reach of the American judicial and military legal systems. The report’s central conclusion is that the spy agency’s interrogation methods — including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other kinds of torture — were far more brutal and far less effective than the C.I.A. acknowledged to policy makers, Congress and the public. For now, it is the most comprehensive chronicle of one of the most controversial counterterrorism programs after the Sept. 11 attacks. The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the C.I.A. for access to the document, and at this point the case hinges on who owns it. Senate documents are exempt from public records laws, but executive branch records are not. In May, a federal judge ruled that even though Ms. Feinstein distributed the report to the executive branch, the document still belongs to Congress. That decision is under appeal, with court papers due this month. Justice Department officials defend their stance, saying that handling the document at all could influence the outcome of the lawsuit. They said that a State Department official who opened the report, read it and summarized it could lead a judge to determine that the document was an executive branch record, altering the lawsuit’s outcome. The Justice Department has also promised not to return the records to Mr. Burr until a judge settles the matter. “It’s quite bizarre, and I cannot think of a precedent,” said Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. He said there are any number of classified Senate documents that are shared with intelligence agencies and remain as congressional records, even if they are read by members of the executive branch. The findings of the report on the secret prisons remain the subject of fierce debate. A group of former senior C.I.A. officers published a book in September challenging its conclusions and methodology, and Senate Republicans have derided the investigation as shoddy and partisan. John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director, said at a conference last month that the report contained “many, many mischaracterizations” of the spy agency’s work in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said that while it focused on “some of the real shortcomings” of the detention program, “it did not take into account the tremendous sacrifice and service of some C.I.A. officers in keeping this country safe.” The full report is not expected to offer evidence of previously undisclosed interrogation techniques, but the interrogation sessions are said to be described in great detail. The report explains the origins of the program and names the officials involved. The full report also offers details on the role of each agency in the secret prison program. The Justice Department, which played a central role in approving the interrogation methods, has even prohibited its own officials from reading the full report. “The Department of Justice was among those parts of the executive branch that were misled about the program, and D.O.J. officials’ understanding of this history is critical to its institutional role going forward,” Ms. Feinstein wrote to the Justice Department last week in a letter she signed with Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. In court, Justice Department lawyers have agreed with Mr. Burr’s contention that the document belongs to Congress. As evidence, they point to an agreement between the C.I.A. and the Senate as the Intelligence Committee began its lengthy investigation. The Senate was under Democratic control at the time. The agreement says that any “documents, draft and final recommendations, reports or other materials” generated during the investigation are congressional documents. “As such these records are not C.I.A. records under the Freedom of Information Act,” the agreement says. The A.C.L.U. argues that agreement was void once Ms. Feinstein sent the report to the government agencies. Because she clearly intended the executive branch to use the report, the A.C.L.U. contends, the committee gave up control of the document. If Mr. Burr were to succeed in getting copies of the report returned to the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Aftergood said, he could slowly make it irrelevant. “The longer that it’s buried, the less relevant it becomes,” he said.","WASHINGTON — A Senate security officer stepped out of the December chill last year and delivered envelopes marked “Top Secret” to the Pentagon, the C.I.A., the State Department and the Justice Department.

But as President Obama’s administration prepares for its final days in office, it is clear that many of those who should have been reading the report are still unaware of its contents. And with no one left at the helm to push for accountability after Mr. Obama leaves office, there appears little chance that any action will be taken against former intelligence officers accused by Ms. Feinstein of torturing detainees during their interrogations. The lack of interest among senior law enforcement officials underscores how difficult it can be even within an agency like the FBI to hold people responsible when they break rules intended to protect Americans. In recent months, several current and retired agents involved in counterterrorism operations have faced charges related to alleged abuses under the Bush administration. Some of them have pleaded guilty; others have fought back. One agent, Ali Soufan, has filed suit accusing the bureau of retaliating against him because he had criticized the use of harsh tactics. Another, John P. Bennett, was charged this month with lying about his role in waterboarding Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Bennett, whose lawyer said he would fight the charge, told investigators that he never participated in such techniques but later acknowledged that he did take part in two sessions involving Mr. Mohammed. He also admitted that he lied about his involvement in the case while testifying before Congress. On Tuesday night, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced criminal charges against four members of the Central Intelligence Agency over the deaths of two men held captive in Thailand more than a decade ago: Abu Zubaydah, whom American authorities believe helped plan the Sept. 11 attack, and Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, who has been linked to other plots. It remains unclear whether anyone else might face prosecution for actions committed years earlier. Lawyers representing Mr. Al Nashiri and another man named in court documents declined to comment Wednesday morning. The C.I.A. declined to discuss details of the investigation into the deaths of the prisoners, which began soon after Mr. Trump took office. But a person briefed on the matter said that while some former C.I.A. operatives suspected of participating in the interrogation programs remain outside the reach of federal prosecutors, others could yet find themselves facing legal consequences. There may be obstacles to bringing cases against those individuals, however. For example, the statute of limitations on murder conspiracy expired long ago in both instances, though it does not apply if someone dies during the commission of a crime. Proving intentional killing, rather than negligence, could prove challenging given the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Also, the government cannot bring a civil rights violation claim without proving that the defendants acted maliciously. Even so, the decision to pursue charges against the C.I.A. personnel shows that the United States is willing to investigate and punish past wrongdoings despite what critics see as the president-elect’s embrace of torture. That stands in contrast to the approach adopted by the George W. Bush administration, which sought to shield those who carried out the policies. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking recently on Fox News Sunday, praised Mr. Trump’s selection of Mike Pompeo to lead the C.I.A., saying he believed Mr. Pompeo would follow through on Mr. Trump’s promise to revitalize America’s efforts to capture terrorists around the world. “He certainly seems to understand the need to do everything we possibly can,” Mr. Cheney said. “And I think that’ll include reinvigorated rendition.” Renditions involve transferring suspects between countries where they fear being captured or killed. Under Mr. Bush, the United States used rendition to send hundreds of people abroad for questioning and detention. Many were sent to third parties, including Egypt, Jordan and Syria, where human rights groups say they suffered torture and mist reatment. While Mr. Trump has promised to make good on campaign promises to strengthen national security — including increasing drone strikes — his choice of Mr. Pompeo suggests that he intends to continue using covert means to combat extremist threats. A spokeswoman for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said she hoped that Mr. Trump would appoint a special counsel to look into the treatment of terrorism suspects. at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba because “the C.I.A.’s role is not transparent.” The agency’s involvement with detainee interrogations was revealed during hearings by Ms. Feinstein’s committee after President Barack Obama released secret documents about its use of harsh tactics against prisoners captured around the world following Sept. 11 attacks. Those revelations led to an investigation by John S. Durham, then United States attorney in Connecticut, who concluded there had been no criminal wrongdoing but found instances where officials may have violated federal law or misled Congress. Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Pompeo comes as the president-elect faces scrutiny over whether Russia tried to influence American elections through cyberattacks. On Thursday, intelligence agencies issued a report saying they were confident that Russian hackers had intervened in the election process. Mr. Trump responded by dismissing their findings. He also attacked James R. Clapper Jr., director of national intelligence under Mr. Obama, accusing him of lying when he testified before Congress last year that Russia was trying to meddle in the election. “Intelligence officials are dead wrong,” Mr. Trump wrote in one Twitter post, adding: “They probably don’t even know how bad it really is!” In another tweet, he called Mr. Clapper “a political animal” whose “reports are way off.” But Mr. Pompeo has a long record of defending the C.I.A. from criticism. As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which oversees the nation’s espionage operations, he took issue with leaks of classified information. And in June, while still running Koch Industries Inc., the energy conglomerate owned by Charles G. and David H. Koch, he criticized former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for calling for more oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency. “It is hard to imagine a worse time for America than now,” Mr. Pompeo told Fox News Channel. “We need our best minds focused on keeping us safe, not second guessing them.” Mr. Pompeo will be tasked with leading the C.I.A. amid what many experts consider unprecedented challenges facing the country. Terrorists armed with crude weapons like knives and trucks have killed scores of people across Europe this fall, prompting fears among some Americans that such violence could spread here. At the same time, the Islamic State continues to hold thousands of foreign fighters captive in Syria and Iraq, raising questions about how the government should deal with those detainees once the group loses territory there. Some Republicans expressed concern that Mr. Pompeo might be too hawkish toward Iran, given his past statements opposing any nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington. Still others wonder if Mr. Pompeo can maintain objectivity regarding the Russians since he owns stock in Koch Industries, which does business in Moscow. Mr. Pompeo is a Harvard Law School graduate who served five terms representing Kansas in Congress starting in January 2011. Before joining Capitol Hill, he worked at Williams & Connolly LLP, a prominent defense firm based in Washington; founded Thayer Capital Partners, a private equity fund; and ran an oilfield services company started by his father. His wife, Susan Pompeo, works as a lawyer for Koch Industries. Mr. Pompeo was considered a favorite candidate for the job early on. After all, he had close ties to Mr. Trump’s transition team and was thought to share Mr. Trump’s views on Russia and other issues. When asked earlier this week why Mr. Pompeo seemed unlikely to get the nomination, Representative Adam Schiff of California, top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, pointed out that the C.I.A. director must win confirmation votes in both chambers of Congress. That requirement makes it harder for presidents to install candidates of their choosing."
"WASHINGTON — In private, President Trump sometimes addresses his adult children as “baby,” a term of endearment tinged with a New Yorker’s wisecracking edge. And now that Mr. Trump’s babies have been swept into the vortex of his storm-tossed presidency, he is taking it personally. The fierce criticism of a meeting between Mr. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Kremlin-linked lawyer in June 2016 has left the president by turns angry, defensive and protective but ultimately relieved that for now, the worst appears to be over, people who spoke to him said Wednesday. For Mr. Trump, who has faced a barrage of questions about his own dealings with Russia, watching his closest family members come under harsh scrutiny for things they are accused of doing to help his presidential campaign has marked an uncomfortable turn in the foreign entanglement that has shadowed him since he took office in January. The latest disclosures also focused renewed attention on Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who attended Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting last June with the Russian, Natalia Veselnitskaya. And they came on the heels of a much-criticized decision by his daughter Ivanka to sit in her father’s vacated chair at a summit meeting in Germany. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump discarded pleas from advisers to avoid wading into the tempest over Donald Trump Jr., and posted a fusillade of tweets defending him. He denounced reports of the meeting — to collect incriminating information about Hillary Clinton — as part of “the greatest Witch Hunt in political history” and even embraced the theory that his son might have been “the victim” in the case. “He was great,” Mr. Trump told people about his son’s appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program the previous evening. By midday Wednesday, the mercurial president was telling friends and advisers that he believed the situation had improved. “I think this is getting better,” he said to one group of aides, hours before he was set to take off for a trip to France to mark Bastille Day. The Trump family, friends said, always draws closer under intense pressure. But Mr. Trump bridles at the idea that his children, who have not spent years in the public spotlight like him, are now facing unrelenting scrutiny over what he believes to be a manufactured scandal by the news media. While Donald Trump Jr. has been on the firing line, the meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya could arguably be a bigger distraction for Mr. Kushner. As a senior adviser to the president, he is involved in several of the administration’s most sensitive foreign-policy issues, from China to the Middle East peace process. His involvement in the meeting led reporters to ask the White House whether he still held his security clearance. Also under scrutiny is how forthcoming Mr. Kushner was with his father-in-law about the nature of the June meeting. He met with Mr. Trump to discuss the issue, according to advisers to the White House, around the time he updated his federal disclosure form to include Ms. Veselnitskaya’s name on a list of foreign contacts that Mr. Kushner was required to submit to the F.B.I. to obtain a security clearance. Mr. Kushner supplemented the list of foreign contacts three times, adding more than 100 names, people close to him said. Mr. Kushner played down the significance of the meeting and omitted significant details, according to two people who were briefed on the exchange. They said Mr. Kushner informed the president that he had met with a Russian foreign national, and that while he had to report the name, it would not cause a problem for the administration. Another official said Mr. Kushner’s assurance to the president was based on the fact that nothing came of the June meeting. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said he had not been told last summer that his son was meeting with a Russian lawyer. “No, that I didn’t know until a couple of days ago when I heard about this,” he said. Mr. Kushner, colleagues say, has kept up a regular work schedule, meeting on Wednesday with Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, to discuss the administration’s impending moves on trade. He is also in touch with Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, who is in Israel for meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. And next week, he plans to take part in a high-level economic dialogue with China. Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka, are not accompanying Mr. Trump to Paris. Instead they plan to attend the annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, sponsored by the investment firm Allen & Company. An official said the couple would pay for their own travel and lodgings. Mr. Kushner is expected to cooperate in the next several weeks with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees that are looking into Russia’s intervention in the American election and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign. He will have to devote some time to preparing for those appearances with his team of lawyers. Colleagues of Mr. Kushner said he had remained focused and upbeat despite the drumbeat of negative headlines — a trait they ascribe to his experience dealing with the legal troubles of his father, Charles Kushner, who was convicted of tax evasion and witness tampering. But even as the White House labors to present a business-as-usual facade, there is evidence that Mr. Trump’s family will be drawn deeper into the investigation. Two officials familiar with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation said the panel was now planning to expand its inquiry to include Donald Trump Jr. The officials said Mr. Trump’s shifting reasons for the meeting — and his acknowledgment that he was lured by the promise of Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton — had forced the Senate panel to begin examining his role in the campaign, and any contacts he may have had with Russians. The first step, officials said, would be for Senate investigators to sit down with Mr. Trump. The Senate panel might also request that he turn over emails and financial records from any dealings with Russia, which they have done with other subjects of their investigation. At the same time, Mr. Kushner now looms larger in the Senate investigation, the officials said. Its investigators concluded as early as March that his meetings during the transition with the Russian ambassador and a Russian banker tied to the Kremlin warranted further scrutiny. For the president, friends said, the pain of seeing his son ensnared in the Russia scandal was real. In part, that is because, of all his children, he has had the most complicated relationship with Donald Jr., who was a teenager when his parents divorced and did not speak to his father for a year. Friends who have known the Trump family for many years said they believed Donald Trump Jr., in setting up the meeting, was only focused on trying to help — and even impress — his father with information that could help his campaign. President Trump has been equally protective of his other children. After Ivanka came under criticism for taking her father’s seat in Germany, he defended her in a tweet and cited Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. “When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries,” he said, “I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!” Nobody offered a more passionate defense of Ivanka than Donald Trump Jr. “Look at the attacks on Ivanka,” he told Mr. Hannity on Tuesday night. “If she was anyone else’s daughter, she’d be a feminist icon — this incredible, brilliant, well-spoken woman. And they try to belittle her at every chance. It’s really sad.” “For me as a family member, as her brother, as her older brother, you know you do take it personally and it does make you want to fight back,” he added. “What we are is we are fighters and they don’t take well to that, either, because most people don’t like being called on their stuff.”","WASHINGTON — In private, President Trump sometimes addresses his adult children as “baby,” a term of endearment tinged with a New Yorker’s wisecracking edge. And now that Mr. Trump’s babies have been swept into the vortex of his storm-tossed presidency, he is taking it personally.","WASHINGTON — In private, President Trump sometimes addresses his adult children as “baby,” a term of endearment tinged with a New Yorker’s wisecracking edge. And now that Mr. Trump’s babies have been swept into the vortex of his storm-tossed presidency, he is taking it personally. when they are criticized for their roles in running the family business and other ventures. The president has told confidants that he feels like an outcast among members of his own family because so many people are attacking them publicly. He believes that the criticism is unfair and unjustified, given how hard all three of his grown sons work to run the Trump Organization while also serving in various government posts. But even if Mr. Trump were not under siege from critics who say there should be no mixing of politics and profit, some ethics experts believe that having one’s relatives working at the same company creates conflicts of interest that cannot easily be resolved. For example: Should Donald Jr., Eric or Ivanka Trump recuse themselves from discussions about foreign policy matters involving countries where the Trump Organization does business? Or would such a move violate federal law by depriving the president of advice on issues affecting American companies overseas? Would any decision made without those advisers be considered influenced by improper motives? Those questions will become more acute after reports this weekend said Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior White House adviser, had met privately last December with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, along with Michael T. Flynn, then the national security adviser, and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. Mr. Kushner later omitted details of that meeting from disclosure forms required of him, according to documents released Friday night by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was considering terminating his eldest daughter’s job as assistant to the president and adviser. Ms. Trump, 35, whose husband, Jared Kushner, serves as a top White House adviser, helped her father win the election campaign before becoming a key player in the administration. Her role has drawn scrutiny since she did not list her position on financial disclosures filed earlier this year. She has defended herself against accusations that she may have broken conflict-of-interest laws by continuing to receive payments from the Trump Organization during her time in Washington. A spokeswoman declined to comment further on Sunday. It remains unclear whether Mr. Trump intends to take action against either of his daughters, but he appears to be most upset about the attacks on his youngest child, Barron. In recent days, Mr. Trump has lashed out repeatedly at critics who question why his wife, Melania, and two teenage sons remain living in Manhattan rather than moving to Washington. Some critics noted that the Trumps could rent space in the White House residence, which is larger and better appointed than the couple’s penthouse near Central Park. Others pointed out that Barron, 10, might find it difficult to adjust to life in Washington immediately following his mother’s transition from first lady to first citizen. Still others suggested that Mrs. Trump might want to stay close to her son until he finishes school next June. “It doesn’t look good,” Mr. Trump complained Saturday evening to friends outside Mar-a-Lago, referring to the criticism directed toward his wife and children. During a dinner party inside the club, Mr. Trump expressed frustration again about what he described as “the horrible things” being written about his family. One guest recalled hearing him complain bitterly about news articles saying that Barron needed to leave behind his friends and start new ones in Washington. Another person present remembered Mr. Trump grumbling about the suggestion that the boy remained in New York City only to help enrich the Trump Organization through its lease of a building housing the Trump International Hotel & Tower. “That’s ridiculous!” the president exclaimed. His anger continued into Sunday morning, when he posted another series of early-morning Twitter messages aimed at his detractors. “The fake news media wants me to apologize for something I didn’t do - my Sons, both daytime and nighttime, are extremely successful,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I am proud of them! Many people would like to see us ‘break up,’ & live apart.” Later, he added: “People love seeing @BarronTrump on @FoxNews. Also @EricTrump & @DonaldJTrumpJr doing great jobs as Execs of @realDonaldTrump org. Very little focus put on that?” In addition to the controversies surrounding his adult children, Mr. Trump faces questions about the potential conflicts posed by his ownership stake in the Trump Organization — estimated between $ 150 million and more than $3 billion — which is being run day-to-day by Donald J. Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump, who are also executive vice presidents at the company. The president has said he will leave control of the organization to them after taking office but has not specified how or when. “The President-elect’s sons have been running the business for years,” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, told CNN last weekend. “They know what they signed up for.” But Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he may be forced to divest from some assets if there were concerns over possible conflicts of interest. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted: “I am greatly looking forward to showing my administration working with you and your group to make America Great Again!” He added later, “We need a good relationship w/ Russia - especially now! As to Russia, we should all be able to get along well together!” It was unclear whether either message referred specifically to the Russian government, though both men had previously expressed hopefulness about improving relations with Moscow. After meeting briefly during an international summit meeting this month in Peru, Secretary Tillerson met again with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia in Geneva on Wednesday afternoon before flying back home. The two men discussed Syria, Ukraine and other issues, according to State Department officials. A senior American official said it appeared likely that Mr. Tillerson would visit Russia soon; the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on any plans. While the Kremlin welcomed news of Mr. Tillerson’s appointment, its foreign minister, Sergei Y. Lavrov, warned against expecting too much change under him. “It remains our position that the U.S.-Russia relationship needs to improve,” Mr. Lavrov said Thursday morning at a joint news conference with his French counterpart, Jean-Marc Ayrault, in Paris. “But one cannot expect miracles because of personnel changes.” Still, Mr. Lavrov said he hoped Mr. Tillerson could help resolve tensions over Syria. “This is something that is very important for us,” he said. The United States and Russia support opposing sides in Syria’s civil war, and their conflicting interests there have led to sharp disagreements among Western powers and prompted the Obama administration to impose sanctions on Russia over its actions in Crimea. Asked why he believed Mr. Tillerson might be better placed to work out differences with Moscow than his predecessor, John Kerry, Mr. Lavrov replied, “Because he is new.” The secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, urged Mr. Tillerson to push ahead with efforts to end the conflict in Syria, where Russian forces have helped prop up President Bashar al-Assad. “In order to achieve peace, stability and security in Syria, we must stop the fighting, reduce violence, allow humanitarian access, start political talks and fight terrorism,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “And we call upon everyone involved to respect the cease-fire agreement.” The British prime minister, Theresa May, congratulated Mr. Tillerson on his confirmation and called him “an experienced leader” whose skills would serve Washington well. She said she looked forward to continuing cooperation with the United States on a range of global challenges including climate change, trade and migration. Ms. May spoke with Mr. Tillerson by phone shortly after he was confirmed by the Senate. Her office said she raised her concern about Russia’s role in eastern Ukraine, particularly around Crimea, and emphasized Britain’s commitment to maintaining economic pressure on Moscow until it complied fully with the Minsk agreements on ending hostilities in Donbass. Mr. Tillerson’s confirmation came amid growing uneasiness within Congress over his nomination. Democrats objected to his past statements calling for closer ties with Russia and criticizing the Obama administration’s policies toward Moscow. Republicans praised Mr. Tillerson’s experience in the oil industry and his longstanding friendship with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president."
"Wells Fargo’s board said on Monday that it would claw back an additional $75 million in compensation from the two executives on whom it pinned most of the blame for the company’s scandal over fraudulent accounts: the bank’s former chief executive, John G. Stumpf, and its former head of community banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. The clawbacks — or forced return of pay and stock grants — are the largest in banking history and among the largest in corporate America. A four-person committee of Wells Fargo’s directors investigated the extensive fraud. Wells Fargo’s board said in a report issued on Monday that Mr. Stumpf had turned a blind eye to the fraudulent accounts being created under his nose and that Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the branch system, had focused obsessively on sales targets and withheld information from her boss and the board. Wells Fargo’s misdeeds, which came to light in September, have at least temporarily become a more widely recognized symbol of the bank than its signature stagecoach. Bankers across Wells Fargo’s giant branch system were tacitly encouraged to meet their sales goals by committing fraud; opening unwanted or unneeded accounts in customers’ names; and, sometimes, moving money into and out of the sham accounts. While the amount of money customers lost was relatively small — the company has refunded $3.2 million — the scope of the fraud was huge: 5,300 bankers were fired for creating as many as two million unwanted bank and credit card accounts. In one detail revealed by the report, a branch manager had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts and a husband with 21. The warning signs were glaring and could be traced back at least to 2004, the investigators said. Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the national network of Wells Fargo branches, set up ruthless sales goals that even she acknowledged were unreachable. Mr. Stumpf, who had a long and trusting relationship with Ms. Tolstedt, left her on her own to run her department, the investigators said in the scathing 113-page report. Neither Ms. Tolstedt, who was allowed to retire in July but was subsequently fired, nor Mr. Stumpf, who was permitted to retire in October after being castigated during congressional hearings on the scandal, was available on Monday to comment. Mr. Stumpf cooperated with the board’s investigation; Ms. Tolstedt declined to be interviewed. All told, Mr. Stumpf will surrender $69 million, and Ms. Tolstedt will lose $67 million, including stock options that they forfeited last year. While those figures are bigger than any previous bank clawback, they fall far short of the largest clawback in corporate history. In 2007, William W. McGuire of UnitedHealthGroup was forced to give back $618 million over backdating options. Ms. Tolstedt’s lawyer, Enu Mainigi of the Washington firm Williams & Connolly, issued a statement challenging the board’s findings. “We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt,” Ms. Mainigi said. “A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion.” The board’s report, compiled by the law firm Shearman & Sterling after interviews with 100 current and former employees and a review of 35 million documents, said it was obvious where the problems lay. Structurally, the bank was too decentralized, with department heads like Ms. Tolstedt given the mantra of “run it like you own it” and granted broad authority to shake off questions from superiors, subordinates or lateral colleagues. Many things collectively should have raised suspicion, the report said. Customers were failing to fund, or put money into, their new accounts at alarming rates. Regional managers were imploring their bosses to drop sales goals, saying they were unrealistic and bad for customers. Particularly in Arizona and Los Angeles, where the toxic culture was most pronounced, some managers explicitly told subordinates to sell people accounts even if they did not need them. Because of the bank’s decentralized structure, the problem went unnoticed for a long time. When it finally came to light — thanks in part to an investigation by The Los Angeles Times — the bank was slow to take action. Mr. Stumpf was warned as early as 2012 about “numerous” complaints about the company’s sales tactics — from both customers and employees — but he ignored growing evidence that the problem was pervasive, the board said in its report. Much of the pressure-cooker climate, the report said, stemmed from Ms. Tolstedt, who led Wells Fargo’s retail branch network for eight years. The report casts her as a powerful and insular leader who set unreasonable targets, castigated those who criticized them and actively ignored signs that some managers and employees were cheating to meet them. “She resisted and rejected the near unanimous view of senior regional bank leaders that the sales goals were unreasonable and led to negative outcomes and improper behavior,” the report said. Timothy J. Sloan, who succeeded Mr. Stumpf as chief executive, was largely exonerated by the report, even though he was also a career Wells Fargo executive. As president and chief operating officer, he became Ms. Tolstedt’s immediate supervisor in November 2015. At that point, the report said, he “assessed her performance over several months before deciding that she should not continue to lead the community bank.” Mr. Stumpf, who retired in October, exercised all of his remaining options and converted them to stock — which he retained — in the months before Wells Fargo announced its $185 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Los Angeles city attorney in September. He held 2.5 million shares as of late February, currently valued at $137 million. Asked about the timing of Mr. Stumpf’s options exercise, Stephen W. Sanger, the board’s chairman and the leader of its investigation, said at a news conference on Monday that it was a routine move that did not raise concern. The $28 million that the board is taking back from Mr. Stumpf — the proceeds of a 2013 equity grant — will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, Mr. Sanger said. Nearly all public companies have clawback provisions, but boards are typically loath to invoke them. Wells Fargo’s example may inspire future directors, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and an expert on corporate governance. “I welcome the move,” he said. “I’m a shareholder of Wells Fargo, and I’m glad they did it.” Mr. Sanger took over as the board’s chairman from Mr. Stumpf. All four members of Wells Fargo’s independent investigation group were on the board before the settlement was announced. The report depicted the board as hoodwinked by bank executives who withheld important facts. It praised the changes the bank had made recently, which include ending sales goals for its retail bank employees. Such conclusions are unlikely to quiet the bank’s critics. Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that advocates stricter regulation of Wall Street, called the report a compendium of “too-little, too-late cosmetic actions” and called on shareholders to oust all of Wells Fargo’s board members at the company’s annual meeting on April 25. Two influential advisory firms have also recommended significant changes to the company’s board. Mr. Sanger said that the report issued on Monday concluded nearly all of the bank’s investigation and that no further terminations or clawbacks were expected. But other investigations — including criminal inquiries by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general — remain in progress, raising the possibility of criminal charges. The board’s law firm is still looking into reports that the bank retaliated against former employees who tried to blow the whistle on its wrongdoing. Last week, a federal regulator, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Labor Department, ordered Wells Fargo to rehire and pay $5.4 million to a former employee who said he was fired after making internal complaints about wrongdoing that he had observed. The agency has also warned Wells Fargo that it is likely to order the bank to reinstate another worker who said she was fired in 2011 after trying to call her supervisors’ attention to accounts that she said had been fraudulently created. So far, Shearman & Sterling has found no evidence of retaliation, said Stuart J. Baskin, a partner at the firm. “We still have a few loose ends, but we don’t think it’s likely to change any findings,” he said. Wells Fargo is eager to put its sales scandal behind it, but customers are not quite so willing to move on. The number of consumer checking accounts opened in February dropped 43 percent compared with a year earlier, and credit card applications declined 55 percent. The financial damage caused to customers by Wells Fargo’s fraudulent acts was relatively minimal, but the issue has loomed large in the public imagination in part because the bank’s transgressions were so blatant — and so simple. “People getting accounts they didn’t sign up for?” said Stephen Beck, the founder of CG42, a strategy company that studies banks’ brand perception. “I don’t need an M.B.A. in finance to understand that’s wrong. Our expectation is that it is going to take quite a bit of time for Wells to recover. You can’t just advertise ‘Trust me,’ which is what they’ve tried to do so far.” Mr. Sloan, the bank president, said at a news conference after the report was issued that he had some regrets about how the bank’s leadership — and he in particular — had handled the years of warnings. “In hindsight, I wish we would have taken more action and would have done things more quickly,” he said. The bank’s sales incentives should have been eliminated sooner, he said. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the law firm that compiled a report on the culture at Wells Fargo. It is Shearman & Sterling, not Shearling & Sterling.","Wells Fargo’s board said on Monday that it would claw back an additional $75 million in compensation from the two executives on whom it pinned most of the blame for the company’s scandal over fraudulent accounts: the bank’s former chief executive, John G.

Stumpf, and its former head of community banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. The clawbacks — or forced return of pay and stock grants — are the largest in banking history and among the largest in corporate America. since 2013, when shareholders began demanding more accountability by top management after a series of financial crises. Mr. Stumpf will lose about half his net worth as he returns nearly $48 million to the San Francisco-based bank. Ms. Tolstedt is giving up roughly one third of her net worth; she has agreed to give back around $19 million. Both resigned last month under pressure following revelations that employees at Wells had opened millions of unauthorized checking and credit card accounts without customers knowing. In addition to the clawbacks announced on Monday, both executives have also given up their bonuses for this year. “We believe these actions send a strong message,” Stephen Sanger, chairman of Wells Fargo’s board, wrote in a letter released along with the announcement. But they do not go far enough, some investors say. Some want the bank to fire Mr. Stumpf, who ran Wells for almost 35 years before stepping down earlier than planned. Others want him to be prosecuted. And others still are calling for the entire board to step aside so new directors can take charge. Many critics point out that the latest round of penalties comes only because of public scrutiny. They argue that if regulators were doing their jobs properly, such abuse should never have occurred. That is why many call for tougher regulation rather than just stronger enforcement. Regardless, the clawbacks represent progress toward holding managers responsible for misdeeds. Until recently, companies typically returned no money even when there was evidence that senior leaders knew what was happening but did nothing to stop it. Even now, few boards make any effort to recoup ill-gotten gains. Last week, Citigroup disclosed that three current and four former executives could face clawbacks totaling tens of millions of dollars related to the bank’s failure to disclose problems with certain mortgage bonds during the housing crisis. But those potential clawbacks came too late for Citi’s former chief executive officer, Vikram Pandit, whose retirement package included $60.2 million in cash and equity awards. He left the bank shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the firm with hiding losses tied to subprime mortgages. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase disclosed that its auditors had discovered errors in how much revenue the bank reported between 2006 and 2008. As a result, the bank will reduce earnings by $2 billion through next quarter. It may owe refunds to clients, including hedge funds, mutual fund families and insurance companies. Those clients stand to gain hundreds of millions of dollars each. But none of them will receive anything directly from JPMorgan. Instead, the bank must file amended tax returns to get the money back from the IRS. While the clawbacks imposed upon Wells Fargo’s executives are large compared with past cases, they fall short of the amounts being sought by lawmakers and consumer advocates. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, called for the government to force Wells Fargo to repay every dollar made off the fake accounts plus interest. She also wants Congress to require all banks to claw back compensation from top officials whenever there is proof of wrongdoing. “The question isn’t whether we need stricter rules against fraud,” Ms. Warren said in a statement. “It’s whether our political system has the courage to enforce existing laws.” Other politicians agree. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, ranking member of the House Committee on Government Reform, said that while the clawbacks sent a powerful signal, they fell short of sending a clear message to other big institutions. “If you break the law, your bonus goes away,” he said. “That needs to become part of the culture here in Washington and across the country.” A spokesman for Wells Fargo declined to comment beyond the statements issued by the bank and the board. But the company signaled that it would continue fighting efforts to impose larger fines or to remove Mr. Stumpf. The bank said that it supported the clawbacks but added: “These measures alone cannot address the root cause of the issues — unacceptable sales practices within our community bank division.” Wells Fargo said that it remained committed to working with regulators to improve standards throughout the industry. “Our goal remains to ensure that every customer interaction meets our high expectations for integrity, respect and caring,” the bank said. For most Americans, however, the $185 million fine is a drop in the bucket compared with what they have lost through years of stagnant wages. And even though some customers will receive refund checks from the settlement, many are still likely to be outraged by how their money was handled at one of America’s largest banks. In 2013, when Wells Fargo began selling credit-card protection plans without telling its customers about them, a consumer advocate called the practice deceptive. But as long ago as 2007, federal lawyers were warning the bank that the tactics could violate antitrust laws because other companies had been barred from offering such products on behalf of Visa and MasterCard. Yet Wells Fargo continued to push ahead with these programs until last year, after news reports revealed that employees had opened millions of fake accounts under pressure from managers who received bonuses based on the number of new accounts created each quarter. On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren accused the Justice Department of failing to hold executives accountable. She noted that Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which has paid billions of dollars over several decades to settle cases involving fraudulent activities like those allegedly carried out by Wells Fargo, testified before Congress this week while no top official from Wells Fargo did so. “The message sent today should not just be ‘Don’t do business with Wells Fargo,’” Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter. “It must also be: Don’t let Wall Street get away with anything again!” A spokesman for the department declined comment on whether any individuals might face charges related to the case against Wells Fargo. Prosecutors typically consider individual liability only if there appears to be evidence of intentional wrongdoing, although sometimes corporations plead guilty to crimes in order to avoid prosecuting lower level officials. It may take months or longer to determine whether anyone will be charged in connection with the Wells Fargo scandal. Meanwhile, the company faces continuing scrutiny over its treatment of workers and consumers. Last month, Wells Fargo agreed to pay more than $60 million to resolve claims brought by state attorneys general in New York and Illinois accusing the bank of charging fees illegally. Earlier this summer, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed suit seeking to block Wells Fargo from forcing customers into arbitration agreements that limit class action suits. That dispute is scheduled to go to trial next June. Also on Friday, Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio; Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey; Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon; Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada; Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon; Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced legislation aimed at preventing financial institutions from creating unauthorized accounts. They argued that the proposed legislative fixes were necessary given the failure of government agencies to punish Wells Fargo. “Wells Fargo engaged in systemic abuse of its customers, and yet instead of holding senior management accountable, we see the same old revolving door between big banks and Washington D.C.,” Mr. Brown said in a statement. “This isn’t right, and I won’t stand idly by watching my constituents lose trust in an institution that continues to fail them time and again.” One measure included in the proposal would require large banks to obtain written consent from customers before opening up checking or savings accounts. Another provision would make it easier for victims of identity theft to sue the banks responsible. Under current rules, people whose Social Security numbers have been compromised can seek redress only through mandatory arbitration proceedings, where disputes are decided behind closed doors rather than in court. The legislation would allow plaintiffs to bring civil actions in court."
"KHOGYANI, Afghanistan — When the American military dropped the largest bomb in its arsenal on an Islamic State cave complex here in eastern Afghanistan in April, the generals justified it as part of a robust campaign to destroy the group’s local affiliate by year’s end. Its force had been reduced to 700 fighters from 3,000, they said, and its area of operation diminished to three districts from 11. But as the year comes to a close, the Islamic State is far from being vanquished in eastern Afghanistan, even as the group is  on the run in its core territory in Iraq and Syria. It has waged brutal attacks that have displaced thousands of families and forced even some Taliban fighters, who had long controlled the mountainous terrain, to seek government protection. The shifting dynamic has, in turn, threatened the American-backed government’s tenuous hold on the region. And two years into the joint United States-Afghanistan operation, a clear understanding of the Islamic State affiliate, the latest enemy in the long Afghan war, still evades even some of those charged with fighting it. Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, recently said that 1,400 operations and airstrikes had “removed from the battlefield” more than 1,600 Islamic State fighters since March — more than double the estimate from early in the year. Some Afghan and other Western officials question whether those numbers are inflated, but the Americans say they are an indication that the group continues to replenish its ranks with new fighters. Part of the reason the two-year joint operation by the United States and Afghanistan against the Islamic State has made little progress is simply that the two forces are operating in a terrain where they have had little control for years. Airstrikes and commando operations bring bursts of pressure, but the militants have release valves all around them. On one side is the porous border with Pakistan, where many of the fighters come from. Elsewhere is largely Taliban country. “It’s like a balloon,” General Nicholson said. “We squeeze them in this area, and they’ll try to move out elsewhere.” A visit this month to Khogyani, a district in the east where Islamic State fighters have shifted, showed the increasing complexity of the Afghan conflict, and underlined how daunting a task it will be to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. The Afghan government’s authority in Khogyani, in a remote region of Nangarhar Province, has long been confined to the district compound and the immediate surroundings. The Taliban ruled the rest. Opium has been grown all around. After years of war with no clear victor, the region had settled into a strange sort of calm as the Taliban and the government found ways to coexist, as has happened to varying degrees around the country. Although the Taliban are known for their opposition to girls’ education, in Khogyani, the militants here allowed schooling, showing a willingness to drop a demand that had lost them hearts and minds before. In return for having nominal control, the government has paid the salaries of teachers and health workers that the Taliban could not afford. Abdul Jabar, who had been displaced from his home near the Pakistan border by recent battles between ISIS and the Taliban, said there was a two-story high school for girls close to his new home, with an enrollment of up to 1,600. Mir Haidar, who distributes vaccinations, said the three clinics there employed women, despite the Taliban’s past opposition to women in the workplace. So established was Taliban rule in Khogyani that when Islamic State fighters started shifting there, many people said they trusted in the Taliban’s protection. Then the Taliban lines started to buckle. “The Taliban were puffing their chest — ‘We are strong, don’t go, we will take care of you,’ ” said Abdul Qadeem, a father of 13. “Then,” he said, the Islamic State “arrived at night, and we left with nothing but this shawl on my shoulder.” The Islamic State’s local affiliate in Afghanistan first emerged in 2014, swiftly gaining ground across Nangarhar Province. It quickly drew the attention of the United States military, which had scaled down its presence in Afghanistan to a small counterterrorism mission against Al Qaeda and a larger NATO mission to train Afghan forces to hold their ground against the Taliban. American and Afghan officials now have little reason to believe that the Afghan group, despite pledging allegiance to ISIS, maintains regular contact or receives directions from the Islamic State operating in Iraq and Syria. Instead, they say, the Islamic State in Afghanistan is largely made up of Pakistani militants pushed across the border by military operations in that country. The militants used the Afghan mountains simply as a safe haven at first, before embracing the Islamic State and turning their weapons on Afghanistan. Opinions are divided on how and why. Some officials believe it was only a matter of time before extremists seeking relevance would be attracted to the Islamic State. Others say the Afghan and American militaries miscalculated and fostered a new enemy by going after Pakistani militants seeking safe havens in Afghanistan in the hopes that the Pakistanis would reciprocate with Afghan Taliban leaders on their soil. A third theory blames the cynical designs of Pakistan’s intelligence agency, which Afghans have long accused of trying to destabilize their government. No matter who they are, the militants have brought more violence and suffering to Afghan civilians. In Khogyani, American airstrikes intended to destroy the Islamic State may have temporarily depleted its forces, but they have also upended the relative peace. Afghan officials say they believe the fighting between the Islamic State and the Taliban has little to do with ideology. “The reason they are fighting each other is over resources, and over territory,” said Mohammed Gulab Mangal, the governor of Nangarhar Province, who says both groups “drink from the same spring” — a subtle reference to their perceived Pakistani origins. People in Khogyani say the Islamic State militants are better armed and fight harder than the Taliban. “If you tie a Taliban fighter to the trunk of this tree, and then you tell him ISIS is coming, he will run so hard that he will uproot the tree with him,” said Malik Makee, a tribal elder who runs a militia of several dozen men in support of the government, helping to maintain a buffer around the district center. Mr. Makee is an example of how fluid alliances can be here. He lived under Taliban rule for years, without much problem, until they killed one of his sons. He retaliated by killing six Taliban, and then packing up to join the government. Mr. Makee — who admits to growing opium, as many in the district do — is one of the three men running the war in Khogyani on behalf of the government. All three are veterans of many previous conflicts. The busiest of them these days is a potbellied intelligence operative in his 50s who is trying to peel away Taliban commanders and foot soldiers fleeing the Islamic State. His agents make a simple argument to potential defectors: You have no escape from the Islamic State, so come to us for protection. About three dozen have. On a recent afternoon, the operative completed a deal with two Taliban over tea and raisins in a dark room of the district compound. The men, both of whom fought the government for six years, were disarmed of a rocket-propelled grenade, a Kalashnikov and a pistol. When the operative asked if the two Taliban had government IDs, they pulled them out, neatly wrapped in plastic sheets. Asked how they had obtained the documents, one of the men, who gave his name as Zabihullah Ghorzang, replied: “My uncle was the district governor here.” Putting his hand on Mr. Ghorzang’s knee, the operative said the men’s decision to join the government’s side was patriotic. The government had forgiven their wrongdoings. The deal complete, Mr. Ghorzang was given back his pistol. But Mr. Makee, who was at the meeting, couldn’t keep quiet. “The government can forgive you for all it wants,” he told the two Taliban. “But if I find out that you had done anything wrong against my men, I swear I will chase you wherever you hide.” Lt. Col. Noor Agha, the third of the three men fighting ISIS here, is a district police chief who cuts a soft-spoken, fatherly figure. He has been in charge of the last line of defense against ISIS: This far into Taliban country, there were no Afghan commandos or American special forces to help out. Colonel Agha has only about 170 regular police officers under his command, 30 of them not present for duty, and about as many militiamen, such as the ones Mr. Makee commands. As residents started fleeing last month from the fighting between the Islamic State and the Taliban, it suddenly appeared that the government could lose even its nominal control if ISIS fighters reached a strategic hill. Colonel Agha carved a road from the district center to the top of the hill, a path made for the first time, 16 years into the war. He cobbled together about 50 men, 20 of them from the army, and they made their way through the poppy fields to establish outposts on the hill. Many of the men on the hill slept under the open sky. They lacked heavy weaponry. As they looked down, it was Taliban to the right, Taliban to the left, Taliban at the foot of the hill. In the distance was the Islamic State, its fighters heavily armed with machine guns and rocket launchers, Col. Agha says. He knows that because his troops have been fired upon and taunted over the radio as infidels and American militias. Letting down his pride for a moment, the colonel admitted they couldn’t fire back. “What can we hit them back with?” In the end, Colonel Agha’s fighters were saved from having to find out by additional Afghan Army units, who arrived to help clear ISIS from Khogyani. Local commanders in recent days say they have killed at least 50, and the rest have started shifting their base of operations — again.","KHOGYANI, Afghanistan — When the American military dropped the largest bomb in its arsenal on an Islamic State cave complex here in eastern Afghanistan in April, the generals justified it as part of a robust campaign to destroy the group’s local affiliate by year’s end. Its force had been reduced to 700 fighters from 3,000, they said, and its area of operation diminished to three districts from 11.","KHOGYANI, Afghanistan — When the American military dropped the largest bomb in its arsenal on an Islamic State cave complex here in eastern Afghanistan in April, the generals justified it as part of a robust campaign to destroy the group’s local affiliate by year’s end. Its force had been reduced to 700 fighters from 3,000, they said, and its area of operation diminished to three districts from 11. . But now, more than two months later, there are signs that the militants have regrouped with new vigor after their defeat at the hands of Afghan forces backed by American airpower. In recent weeks, they have carried out deadly attacks against government officials and security personnel across several provinces, including one last weekend when eight police officers were killed near Kabul. The resurgence is raising questions about whether President Trump’s strategy for defeating terrorism abroad has failed or will fail before he leaves office next January. It also highlights how difficult it can be to eradicate extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State even if they lose territory and leadership figures. “Their morale was very low,” said Gen. Mohammad Radmanesh, commander of the Afghan Army corps responsible for this region. Now, he added, “they feel much stronger.” He spoke recently during a visit to Khogyani district, where the United States bombed the Islamic State hideout earlier this spring. Afterward, he said, his soldiers found weapons caches hidden underground beneath houses and schools and other places where civilians lived. They discovered training camps, too: A former schoolhouse had been converted into a jihadi camp, complete with dormitories, classrooms and a library stocked with books on religion and warfare. Many of those who fled the fighting returned home only days ago. They include families whose sons joined the Taliban but then switched sides because the group refused to join the fight against ISIS. Some say they did so because they feared being killed by the Americans; others wanted revenge for relatives slain by the insurgency. Still others simply decided that both groups were equally bad. “We don’t want anyone to come kill us again,” said Abdul Aziz, a farmer in his late teens who had spent six years working alongside the Taliban until switching allegiance. He wore a traditional shawl over a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with a skull-and-crossbones logo. His family’s house bore scars from the fighting, which left many homes destroyed beyond repair. Mr. Aziz’s brother died while serving with the Taliban, and another son was wounded. “If we go back to our old life, I think my children would get sick again,” he said. While some residents expressed gratitude toward the Americans for liberation them from the rule of the Islamic State, most still harbor deep suspicion of foreign troops. And many complain bitterly about what they see as indiscriminate use of power by the allied forces. On June 26, an American soldier opened fire inside Bagram Air Base, killing four Afghans and wounding five others. An investigation concluded that the shooting stemmed from a dispute between the victims and the shooter over money owed him for work performed outside the base gates. No charges were filed, although the episode raised concerns among locals about the safety of living around bases. Two days later, two rockets fired from an unknown location struck the sprawling facility, injuring nine people. The attack came amid a spike in violence nationwide, and it followed reports of increased activity by the Islamic State. Last month, a suicide car bombing targeted a convoy carrying Vice President Ashraf Ghani through Nangarhar Province, killing seven members of the presidential guard and wounding dozens of others. Days later, a rocket strike hit Camp Shaheen, headquarters of the Afghan army’s 209th Corps, located less than half a mile away from the governor’s residence in Jowzjan Province. There were no casualties reported, but the blast damaged vehicles and buildings. Then, on July 8, gunmen attacked a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Kabul, leaving 45 people injured. That same day, a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of a mosque in Logar Province, killing 15 worshipers and wounding scores more. This past Sunday night, a suicide bomber detonated explosives strapped to his body inside a mosque in Herat Province, killing at least three people. All told, the number of civilian deaths caused by the conflict rose 3 percent compared with the previous year, according to data compiled by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. More than 7,000 civilians lost their lives since 2014 alone — nearly double the figure recorded just two years prior. Although the number of military fatalities fell slightly, the overall trends remain grim. Since 2014, the annual average number of combatants killed has been around 6,850; this is roughly triple what it was when NATO forces first began withdrawing from the country five years ago and a staggeringly high rate for an insurgency that has been fighting on for decades. The latest figures are likely to be seen as another sign of deterioration after more than 16 years of warfare. President Ashraf Ghani’s government has struggled to gain control over large parts of the country amid a resurgent Taliban offensive and rising attacks by Islamic State militants. In recent months, Mr. Ghani has come under pressure at home to take tougher action against his political opponents while also trying to negotiate peace talks with the Taliban. “The situation remains dire,” said Tadamichi Yamashita, the United Nations special envoy for Afghanistan, who noted that the increase in casualties came despite fewer security incidents last month than during any other July since records were kept in 2009. The report found that suicide bombings accounted for about half of all civilian killings last month, followed by ground engagements between armed groups or pro-government forces. Civilian casualty rates have risen steadily each year since 2012, even though the total number of such deaths declined slightly last year. At least part of the reason may lie in how the United Nations defines civilian deaths: Those who die because they are caught up in violence but do not actively participate in hostilities are counted among them. That includes children whose parents are members of the Taliban or other insurgent factions. Still, many analysts say that the numbers reflect broader problems afflicting Afghan society. As foreign troops draw down and leave behind weak local governments, there is little hope for stability without strong institutions and robust economic growth. But corruption runs deep through every level of government, making it difficult to provide services like health care and education. And the growing influence of drug traffickers means that much of the economy revolves around narcotics production and smuggling operations. Most Afghans live in poverty, which leaves them vulnerable to exploitation by criminal gangs. Many young men turn to crime to support themselves and their families. Others join terrorist organizations out of desperation and hopelessness. Ahmadi Wali, a resident of Kabul, described life in her neighborhood as miserable. She said she had no money to send her daughter to school and could barely afford food. Her husband worked odd jobs here and there, often doing manual labor. He tried to make ends meet working construction but had difficulty finding work. Ms. Wali said she did not know where her family would get its next meal. “I don’t want my child to grow up thinking that we can only eat bread and rice,” she said. “We need help.” The Taliban controls some areas of Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan and several districts along the border region with Pakistan. It also holds sway over vast swathes of Helmand Province in the southwest, including Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital. Last week, the group seized the district center of Musa Qala in neighboring Nimruz Province before moving north toward Zaranj, the main city of Nimruz. The fall of Musa Qala marked one of the biggest setbacks yet suffered by the Afghan army, which until recently controlled most of the province. Both sides blamed each other for starting the fight. The Taliban claimed responsibility for seizing Musa Qala, saying fighters entered the town after government soldiers fled. An official statement issued by the Ministry of Defense accused the Taliban of attacking police checkpoints outside the town. Officials in Kabul denied losing territory and vowed to recapture the area soon. “This is our land and we will never give it away,” said Gen. Dawlat Zaman, commander of the Second Army Corps, based in Helmand."
