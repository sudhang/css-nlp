"BERLIN — The fate of Adolf Hitler’s birthplace in the picturesque Austrian border town of Braunau has been fiercely debated at least since victorious American G.I.s stopped the Nazis from destroying the house at the end of World War II. Now Austria plans to end the dispute, drafting a law that would enable the government to seize the property and decide on its final use. Discussions continue, said Karl-Heinz Grundböck, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Vienna, but a draft law is expected to go to Parliament by summer while a commission of experts considers the building’s fate. The boy who became Hitler was born in Braunau on April 20, 1889, in an apartment rented to his parents above what was a tavern. After moving as a young man to Vienna and failing as an artist, Hitler went to Munich. There, he led a failed coup and spent time in prison before rising to power as head of the Nazi party, then as chancellor of Germany. He committed suicide as Allied troops were seizing Berlin in 1945. Hitler paid no attention to Braunau, preferring instead to amass thousands of works of art and make grandiose plans for a vast museum in his honor in the northern Austrian city of Linz. Yet Martin Bormann, a high-ranking Nazi, acquired and restored the Braunau property, which became something of a place of pilgrimage from 1938 until 1945. The family that had owned the house bought it back after the war. A descendant, Gerlinde Pommer, has refused in recent years to sell the increasingly decrepit building to the Austrian government or to undertake repairs. The last tenant — a workshop for the disabled — moved out in 2011. Mr. Grundböck, reached by telephone on Saturday, said the future of the building was not clear. Historians have pressed for years for an exhibit that would promote peace and dispel any possibility that the site could become a shrine for neo-Nazis. A memorial stone outside the three-story building is the only outward sign of its uniqueness. The marble slab bears an inscription: “For Peace, Freedom and Democracy/Never Again Fascism/Millions of Dead Warn.” The Austrian government and the City of Braunau have rented the building from the owners since 1972, and still pay Ms. Pommer about 5,000 euros, or about $5,700, a month. Mr. Grundböck confirmed a report in Der Spiegel, the German weekly newsmagazine, that Austria’s Interior Ministry was determined that the house should never represent “an affirming memory of National Socialism.”","BERLIN — The fate of Adolf Hitler’s birthplace in the picturesque Austrian border town of Braunau has been fiercely debated at least since victorious American G.I.s stopped the Nazis from destroying the house at the end of World War II.

"CLEVELAND — Opening a new front in the abortion wars, abortion opponents are pushing Ohio to make it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion if a woman is terminating her pregnancy to avoid having a baby with Down syndrome. The legislature is expected to approve the measure this fall because lawmakers endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee, which supports the bill, make up more than two-thirds of both houses. Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican who is running for president, opposes abortion but has not yet taken a position on this bill. Since his election in 2010, he has signed a variety of abortion restrictions, including a law requiring women to have an ultrasound and be offered a chance to see an image of the fetus before undergoing the procedure. Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life, said his group had made the bill here a legislative priority because Down syndrome is so recognizable, so easily diagnosed in pregnancy — and so likely to lead to abortion. “We all want to be born perfect, but none of us are, and everyone has a right to live, perfect or not,” he said. “You go to any supermarket or mall and see these families who just happen to have a child with Down syndrome, and they will tell you how fortunate they are to have those children. Pretty soon, we’re going to find the gene for autism. Are we going to abort for that, too?” But abortion rights lawyers say such a law would violate the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, which guarantees a woman’s right to seek an abortion until the fetus is viable. They also say that by focusing on the diagnosis of a fetal condition, it edges toward recognizing the fetus as a person, setting up a conflict between the mother’s interests and those of the fetus. Between 60 and 90 percent of fetal Down syndrome diagnoses lead to abortion, according to an academic article reviewing research studies from 1995 to 2011 on the percentage of women who choose to terminate their pregnancies. Over the last four decades, dozens of states have regulated access to abortion through waiting periods, clinic regulations or limits on how far along the pregnancy can be. Laws banning abortion based on motivation are far less common. In 2013, North Dakota made it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion because of fetal genetic anomalies, including Down syndrome. Indiana, Missouri and South Dakota considered similar laws this year. Seven states — Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Dakota — have laws banning abortions if the reason is gender selection. In 2012, the United States House of Representatives rejected such a measure. Arizona’s law also forbids abortion when the doctor knows “that the abortion is being sought based on the sex or race of the child, or the race of a parent of that child.” Advocates are not aware of enforcement of any such laws in the states that have them.  “They’re trying to encroach on the right to abortion, step by step, and turn a woman’s health care decision into an issue of discrimination against the fetus,” said Sara Ainsworth, the director of legal advocacy at the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. “I can’t imagine how any of these laws would be enforceable.” There have been no prosecutions under the 2013 North Dakota law, advocates on both sides say. Nor has the law changed anything at the state’s only abortion provider, the Red River Women’s Clinic in Fargo, said Tammi Kromenaker, its director. “We have not had any women who presented saying they need an abortion because of a fetal diagnosis,” she said. “I believe there are real women affected by this, but not at our clinic. If someone did come in saying that, we would refer her to a clinic in Minneapolis.” Here, in a leafy residential neighborhood on Cleveland’s east side, where Naral Pro-Choice Ohio shares offices with Preterm, a nonprofit abortion clinic, local abortion rights advocates say the bill drives a wedge between supporters of disability rights and backers of abortion rights. “This is interference with a medical decision following a complicated diagnosis,” said Kellie Copeland, the executive director of Naral Pro-Choice Ohio. “For us, it comes down to who makes the decision and who’s going to have to live with it. Not knowing the family and the circumstances, the legislature can’t possibly take into account all the factors involved.” National and local Down syndrome associations have not taken a position on the bill. But some parents of children with Down syndrome are strong proponents. At a May hearing on the bill, Heather Bellegia-Ernst, a mother of a child with Down syndrome, testified that “with nine out of 10 babies with Down syndrome being aborted, extinction is what we are really talking about.” Rachel Mullen, 43, a mother of three who heads the recently formed Cuyahoga County chapter of Ohio Right to Life, said in an interview that her doctors had pressured her to have an abortion after an early screening test in one of her pregnancies showed a possibility of Down syndrome. “They told me that I should get an abortion fast, so no one would know I was pregnant and I wouldn’t have the stigma of abortion, that it would be doing the child a favor,” she said, adding that subsequent testing ruled out the Down diagnosis. “As soon as babies are born, they’re protected by the Americans With Disabilities Act, but we need this bill so that they can be born, and not culled.” Some doctors in Cleveland — where the most abortions in Ohio are performed — fear the bill would discourage patients from having honest discussions about a tough decision. “If abortion on demand is legal,” said Dr. Marjorie Greenfield, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, “and you can have an abortion just because you want to, what does it mean to say you can’t abort for Down syndrome? It seems bizarre.” Indeed, there is currently no requirement for a woman to disclose her motivation for terminating a pregnancy.  Ohio is one of the most anti-abortion states in the nation, the first to introduce a bill that, had it passed, would have banned abortions after six weeks, when a heartbeat can be heard. In July a federal appeals court found such a law in North Dakota unconstitutional. Another bill, which would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks, is still pending in Ohio. The legislature, which reconvenes in mid-September, has also imposed new regulations on abortion clinics. Since Mr. Kasich took office, the number of clinics in the state that perform abortions has decreased to nine, from 16. Mr. Kasich appointed Mr. Gonidakis, the Ohio Right to Life president, to the state medical board. At the Preterm clinic, about 66 of the 5,000 abortions that will be performed this year will be for fetal abnormalities, including Down syndrome and conditions, like anencephaly, that are fatal, said Chrisse France, the executive director. “They’re very sad, because these are mostly intentional, much-wanted pregnancies, where they paint the nursery one day and find out the next day that something’s wrong,” she said. “Most people who have abortions already have children, and they say things like, ‘I just can’t be the kind of parent I want to be to this child.’ ” The main effect of restrictive laws, she said, is to “squeeze vulnerable women and make them feel more ashamed, and that’s what the Down syndrome law would do, too.”","CLEVELAND — Opening a new front in the abortion wars, abortion opponents are pushing Ohio to make it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion if a woman is terminating her pregnancy to avoid having a baby with Down syndrome.

If enacted, the law would require doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital where they can provide care to women who want an abortion. “It’s not just about abortion,” said Representative Nancy Gorman, a Republican from Cleveland, who is sponsoring the bill. “It’s about access to care.” The legislation was introduced last year as a way to protect women whose pregnancies are complicated by fetal anomalies that could lead to serious health problems or even death. But abortion rights groups and many Democrats say it will also prevent women from getting abortions. “The bill is really about protecting women’s health and their right to terminate a pregnancy,” said Dr. Mark Tushnet, the president of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio. “We’re trying to protect women’s health.” The measure has been met with fierce opposition from abortion rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it would infringe on women’s constitutional rights. “We don’t believe that the bill is going to be successful,” said ACLU attorney Sarah Warbelow, who is representing the group in litigation against the measure. “We’re hoping that the Supreme Court will rule that the states have the right to regulate abortion.” In the Senate, the measure faces stiff resistance from Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, who is sponsoring the legislation. He has said he does not support abortion rights and has said he does not support the law requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital. “I do not support abortion,” Mr. Merkley said in a statement. “I am pro-life. I have always been.” The measure has been backed by the Ohio Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Ohio Medical Association. It has also received support from the National Abortion Federation and the Ohio Coalition for Reproductive Rights. But abortion rights groups have warned that the law would force women to travel long distances to get abortions, which would increase costs and make it harder for women to pay for them. The law would also impose restrictions on how clinics can operate, including requiring that women seeking an abortion be screened by a nurse before they can be admitted. That screening would include asking questions like “are you anemic?” and “are you pregnant?” Abortion rights groups say the law would undermine women’s constitutional rights to privacy and bodily integrity. They say that women would be forced to give birth to babies they did not want. “This is really about the constitutional rights of women,” said Susan B. Anthony List, president of the anti-abortion group NARAL Pro-Choice America. “This is about the constitutional rights of women to terminate a pregnancy.” The measure has also drawn support from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which says it would protect women’s health. “Abortion is a very safe procedure,” said Dr. David M. W. Jones, the chief medical officer for the association. “The most important thing is that it’s done safely.” The measure has been supported by abortion rights groups, including the Center for Medical Progress, which reported last month that Planned Parenthood officials had secretly videotaped a Planned Parenthood clinic in Cincinnati to document its procedures. The footage showed women undergoing a variety of procedures, including dilation and evacuation, a common abortion procedure. The Center for Medical Progress has released the video online. The Center for Medical Progress, founded by James O’Keefe, has been criticized for releasing videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing fetal tissue donation for research. The Center for Medical Progress has also released videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing how to dispose of aborted fetuses. The center’s director, Joseph R. Whalen, said in an interview that the organization had no intention of publishing the videos. “We are not making any profit off of this,” he said. “We are simply trying to raise awareness of what is happening.” The measure has also drawn support from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which said it would protect women’s health. “We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Dr. Richard J. Matt, the associate medical director of obstetrics and gynecology at the association . “We’re seeing a lot of pressure from both the public and the media, and we’re seeing a lot of concern that the bill is going to be bad for women’s health.” The measure has also received support from the Ohio Medical Association, which said it would protect women’s health. The measure has been endorsed by the Ohio Coalition for Reprodu ctive Rights and Planned Parenthood. But the bill faces stiff opposition from Republicans who say it will make abortion more expensive and difficult to access. They have vowed to fight it in court and have threatened to block it from being enacted. “The Republican Party has long opposed abortion rights,” said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who has been one of the most vocal opponents of the bill. “This bill is not about abortion, but it’s about the right to safe, legal access to contraception.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Portman said he had no comment on the bill. The measure has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where Democrats are expected to vote against it. The measure has also been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bill has also been referred to the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Portman has been one of the most outspoken critics of the law, saying that President Barack Obama and his appointees were trying to dismantle it. In recent weeks, Mr. Portman has been at the center of the debate over the Affordable Care Act, a landmark legislation that has provided coverage to millions of Americans. He has been an ardent supporter of the law, and has pushed for the repeal of the law. Mr. Portman is also one of the most outspoken critics of abortion rights, saying that the Supreme Court should overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion in the United States. He has called the current law “the worst thing that ever happened to women’s health care,” and has said that the law should be “reversed.” Mr. Portman has also been critical of the contraceptive coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act, saying it was unconstitutional. The measure has also been referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. A spokesman for Mr. Portman said the senator did not comment on the bill. . The bill would allow states to opt out of the contraceptive coverage requirement by offering their own version of the coverage. It would also require that all contraceptives be covered by insurance plans sold by employers or government programs, and would impose new penalties on people who fail to comply with the requirements. The bill would also allow the state to prohibit the use of certain contraceptives by minors. The bill would also allow women to obtain contraceptives without a prescription, and would allow them to get contraceptives without a doctor’s order. The bill would allow a woman to terminate her pregnancy after a doctor’s diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. It would also allow a woman to terminate her pregnancy before she is 18 years old. The bill would allow states to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape or incest. It would also allow women to get abortions after 20 weeks if they were victims of rape or incest.

"APODACA, Mexico — In 30 years at Whirlpool, working at the company’s manufacturing plant in this industrial Mexican town, José Luis Rico has witnessed some pretty major changes. The work force has grown, churning out refrigerators that look more like robots than the simple models of his early career. Fueling the changes was a free-trade agreement among Mexico, Canada and the United States that promised to lift Mexico into the future. What did not seem to go up, however, was Mr. Rico’s salary. After a handful of raises, he still earns well under $10,000 a year — a sum, he argues, that hardly makes Mexico the big winner of the North American Free Trade Agreement that President-elect Donald J. Trump says it is. In fact, to Mr. Rico and many other Mexican workers, politicians and economists, Nafta does not feel much like a win at all. “It’s more like survival,” Mr. Rico said. “I thought it would make my life better, that this agreement would create opportunities for everyone.” “Maybe it has,” he added, nodding toward the Whirlpool logo on the entrance to the complex. “Just not for us.” Mr. Trump made questioning the virtues of Nafta a centerpiece of his campaign, at one point calling it “the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere,” and he has not slowed down since his election. On Tuesday alone, he criticized General Motors for shipping cars made in Mexico to the United States, claimed credit for a decision by Ford to cancel plans for a new factory in Mexico, and named a well-known advocate of protectionist policies, Robert Lighthizer, his chief trade negotiator. His argument has driven the narrative that where the American worker lost, the Mexican economy gained. But here in Mexico, there is an increasing belief that Nafta, despite drawing an enormous amount of investment to the country, has been a big disappointment. “At the end of the day, as a development strategy, it should have led to higher sustained growth, generated well-paid salaries and reduced the gap between Mexico and the United States,” said Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at the Colegio de México. “It has remained well below what was hoped for.” Mexico’s economy has grown an average of just 2.5 percent a year under Nafta, a fraction of what was needed to provide the jobs and prosperity its supporters promised. More than half of Mexicans still live below the poverty line, a proportion that remains unchanged from 1993, before the deal went into effect. Wages in Mexico have stagnated for more than a decade, and the stubborn gap between the nation’s rich and poor persists. A majority of workers in Mexico toil in the obscurity of under-the-table jobs at workshops, markets and farms for their survival. New technologies, meanwhile, have cut many jobs while increasing productivity, which is good news for businesses but a blow to the work force. “Mexico is seeing exactly the same phenomenon as in the United States,” said Timothy A. Wise, a research fellow at Tufts University. “Workers have declining bargaining power on both sides of the border.” In part, Nafta’s failure to achieve its potential falls on the Mexican government’s shoulders, experts say. Rather than use the agreement as a launching point to grow and invest in many sectors of the Mexican economy, successive governments viewed the trade deal as a silver bullet for the country’s economic woes. All of this is not lost on Mexicans, despite their government’s defense of Nafta. A recent poll by Parametría, a respected Mexican pollster, found that more than two-thirds of respondents believed that Nafta had benefited American consumers and businesses, while just 20 percent believed it had been good for them. The poll, consisting of 800 interviews in people’s homes, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. “There is a grand narrative in the United States that Mexico was the great winner of Nafta,” said Fernando Turner Dávila, the secretary of the economy and labor in the industrial state of Nuevo León. “Meanwhile, here in Mexico, they only see the benefits, which are glorified. They never see the downsides, much less talk about them.” Mr. Turner cited the loss of nearly two million jobs in the agricultural industry because of the treaty, which benefited highly subsidized industries in the United States like corn to the detriment of Mexican farmers. And while the federal government lauds the increase in manufacturing exports, Mexico still relies on a tremendous number of imports from the United States. “The Mexican government has not established policies to protect Mexican businesses,” said Mr. Turner, himself a businessman, with factories in a half-dozen countries. That said, even critics like Mr. Turner do not want to see Nafta gutted. It is an imperfect deal, one that has failed to deliver on its promise, he said. But to terminate the treaty would be a disaster, he said, hurting both Mexico and the United States and creating even more job losses. It would also not happen easily, critics contend. After two decades, the two economies are tightly braided together. Goods manufactured by companies operating in both countries — whether speakers, cars or airplanes — cross the border multiple times during production, a shared manufacturing process that, if destroyed, would mean shared job losses. “A lot of people are taking solace in the reality that it’s very difficult for the U.S. to impose tariffs on Mexico without damaging the U.S. economy as well,” said Christopher Wilson, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Institute. “You need something to replace Nafta. Otherwise you’re going to leave a lot of American workers out in the cold.” The agreement has certainly brought positive changes to Mexico, economists note. Since it went into effect at the beginning of 1994, billions of dollars in investment has been pouring into Mexico every year. Sleepy provincial towns have become manufacturing hubs. Workers assemble Ford Fusion Hybrid cars in the city of Hermosillo and Whirlpool refrigerators outside Monterrey. Tijuana sends flat-screen televisions across the border and the state of Querétaro hammers out parts for helicopters and corporate jets. For two decades, those exports have been the main driver of growth in Mexico, which is why Mexico’s government is so eager to defend the country’s trade relationship with the United States. Without the agreement, the foreign investment that creates new jobs will slow, or even vanish, some fear. Mexicans got a forewarning of the possible effect this week. After poor sales and criticism from Mr. Trump, Ford announced that it would cancel a planned car plant in San Luis Potosí, a state that Nafta has transformed into a hub for auto manufacturing. “Mexico has done a lot right,” said Gordon H. Hanson, a trade expert at the University of California, San Diego. “It has a lot to be proud of. It has developed a middle class that lives in cities, that educates their children. It’s not the Mexico of 1993.” The image of these bustling factories feeds the idea that Mexico is responsible for the hollowing out of America’s industrial heartland. But the reality has turned out to be much more complicated. While American companies moved jobs to lower-wage Mexico to remain competitive, some new jobs emerged in the United States, in design or engineering, or in plants to make parts for the Mexican factories. In the end, “Nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,” the Congressional Research Service concluded in 2015. In Mexico, the hope was to mimic the success of East Asia’s so-called tigers, using free trade as the catalyst to modernize and overhaul the economy through exports. Instead, Mexico produced the exports, but not the growth. It even fell behind most other countries in Latin America during the 2000s. But Nafta was not necessarily the problem. Much of the misstep, experts say, was the Mexican government’s belief that the agreement would be enough to transform the economy all by itself. Thinking of the trade deal as a panacea, the government failed to come up with a broader policy or make the investments needed to use the trade agreement as a lever to transform the whole economy. Investments in research and development, for instance, have failed to materialize in both the public and private sectors. Government spending on infrastructure has dropped to its lowest level in seven decades, experts say, leaving an unreliable network of ports, highways and even internet connections across the country. Burdensome regulation and corruption stifled investment, while the nation’s banks lent far less than their Latin American peers, leaving small companies to scramble for credit. Even where Nafta is succeeding, it is not pushing wages up, or creating enough needed jobs. Rodolfo de la Torre, an economist with the Espinosa Yglesias Center for Studies in Mexico City, said officials initially hoped Nafta would bring jobs to the mass of poorly educated workers in Mexico. But by the early 2000s, much of that low-skilled work had left for China, where labor was cheaper. Jobs for better-educated workers in Mexico remained, in part because of the technological advances in the industrial plants. Now, in many of the manufacturing hubs of Mexico, wages, and hopes, have been frozen. For 10 years, Jorge Augustín Martínez has driven a forklift for Prolec, a joint venture with General Electric that makes transformers. A father of two, he earns about $100 for a six-day workweek. Though he has received modest cost-of-living increases, his last raise was five years ago, when gas, food and household items were far cheaper, he said. It was also before his second son was born. Between housing, insurance, savings and other requisites, he is left with about $40 a week to buy food and other necessities for his family, he said. Some of the engineers in the plant make more, he said, but no one is thriving. “We’re all the same, fighting to make ends meet,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who is very comfortable.”","APODACA, Mexico — In 30 years at Whirlpool, working at the company’s manufacturing plant in this industrial Mexican town, José Luis Rico has witnessed some pretty major changes.

The work force has grown, churning out refrigerators that look more like robots than the simple models of his early career. . The machines are quieter and more efficient, with fewer parts and less noise. And the workers are happier. But it is not just the machines that have changed. Mr. Rico, a former engineer, is also seeing the rise of a new breed of worker: the “superman” who works alongside machines. “I used to think that only the best people could do this job,” he said. “But now I see that the best people can do this job as well.” Supermen are a growing category of workers in factories across the United States, where machines are replacing human labor in everything from car assembly lines to fast food restaurants. They are also common in many other industries, including hospitality, retail, health care and even medicine. “We’re seeing a lot of supermen,” said David A. Friedman, a professor of sociology at New York University who studies supermen. “They’re really rare, but they’re everywhere.” The number of supermen is still small, but their presence is growing rapidly, according to several surveys, surveys by employers and surveys by workers themselves. The number of supermen in the United States has risen by nearly 50 percent since 1999, according to a report released last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The growth has been driven by an increase in the number of jobs in machine-related industries, such as auto assembly lines, pharmaceuticals and electronics. Many of these jobs pay better than traditional jobs in manual labor, which is often seen as beneath a person’s station in life. In the past decade, the number of supermen in the United States has risen by more than 200 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the growth of supermen is not uniform. Some companies have been hiring more supermen, while others have been reducing the number of supermen. “Supermen are a very new phenomenon,” said John K. Diggins, a sociologist at Ohio State University who studies supermen. “The data shows that there is a lot of variability in how people define supermen.” The term “superman” was first used by Dr. Diggins in the 1960s. He was referring to a group of men who were among the top 1 percent of all American workers. The term has since been applied to a broader range of people, including athletes, celebrities and politicians. For example, President Obama has referred to himself as a “superman,” and the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger has called himself a “superman.” The term “superman” has also been used to describe people who have achieved a level of excellence that is higher than that of most other people in society, such as the best players in the world. At the same time, the term has been used to describe people who have achieved a level of excellence that is lower than that of most other people in society. For example, the best basketball player in the world, LeBron James, is not considered a superman because he is not considered one of the elite players in the country. “The definition of what a superman is is very different from what a superman is,” said Dr. Diggins. “So we’re talking about two very different groups of people.” Dr. Diggins said that the term “superman” was first used to describe a group of people who were among the top 1 percent of all American workers, but that it was later applied to a broader range of people, including athletes, celebrities and politicians. “The definition of what a superman is is very different from what a superman is,” he said. “So we’re talking about two very different groups of people.” Dr. Diggins said that the term “superman” was first used to describe a group of people who were among the top 1 percent of all American workers, but that it was later applied to a broader range of people, including athletes, celebrities and politicians. “The definition of what a superman is is very different from what a superman is,” he said. “So we’re talking about two very different groups of people.” Dr. Diggins said that the term “superman” was first used to describe a group of people who were among the top 1 percent of all American workers, but that it was later applied to a broader range of people, including  athletes, celebrities and politicians. “The definition of what a superman is is very different from what a superman is,” he said. “So we’re talking about two very different groups of people.” Dr. Diggins said that the term “superman”  was “a bit of an overstatement.” He added that it was “not a term I think many people would agree with.” The term “superman” was first used in the late 1960s by Bruce Lee, who played a character called “Superman” in the 1970s television series “The Avengers.” In the 1990s, the term was revived by athletes like Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, who all played their own versions of the character. Now, Dr. Diggins said, “superman” had become “a catch-all phrase for people who are really good at something and can do something that nobody else can do.” He said that the most common use of the term was to describe someone who was exceptionally athletic, especially in sports. “I don’t know why, but there’s been a lot of athletes who have used the term,” he said. “It’s not a bad word, but it’s not a very flattering term.” Dr. Diggins said that while his father, a retired lawyer, was a great athlete, his mother was not. “My mom was a very shy person,” he said. “She didn’t want to be noticed. She didn’t want to be known.” Dr. Diggins said that his parents were not wealthy. His mother, he said, earned $12 an hour as a secretary. “I think she was a very modest person,” he said. “She never wanted to be a star. She always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom.” When Dr. Diggins was growing up, he said, he would often hear his mother say that she was “not going to be famous.” “I think she was just trying to keep us from being famous,” he said. “And I think she was trying to keep us from being a burden on her.” Dr. Diggins said that his mother’s nickname was “the big housewife” because she was so busy taking care of everyone, including him. “I think she was just trying to keep us out of trouble,” he said. “But she was also trying to keep us away from the spotlight.” Dr. Diggins said that his mother died when he was 10 years old. He said that his mother’s death made him feel “very alone.” “I think my biggest regret is that I wasn’t around to see her when she was alive,” he said. “I think that was probably the biggest regret of my life.” Dr. Diggins said that he and his brother, Chris, were raised by their grandmother, who was a strict disciplinarian. “He was very much a rebel,” Dr. Diggins said. “He was a little bit of a rebel.” Dr. Diggins said that his brother was a “great guy,” but that they did not have much money. “We never had any money,” he said. “We didn’t have a car. We didn’t have anything.” Dr. Diggins said that his brother worked at a local grocery store, and that his mother did not work outside the home. “My mom was a stay-at-home mom,” he said. “She never worked outside the home.” Dr. Diggins said that he and his brother did not have much contact with their father after his death. “We never really talked to him,” he said. “We never really talked to him.” Dr. Diggins said that his father was a “very quiet man,” but that he did not have much contact with him. “He was a very private person,” he said. “He never talked to us.” Dr. Diggins said that his father died when he was 19 years old. “I think he was a very lonely man,” he said. “He never talked to us.” Dr. Diggins said that his father was a “very religious man,” but that he did not have much contact with him."
"In his first remarks on the vast California wildfires that have killed at least seven people and forced thousands to flee, President Trump blamed the blazes on the state’s environmental policies and inaccurately claimed that water that could be used to fight the fires was “foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” State officials and firefighting experts dismissed the president’s comments, which he posted on Twitter. “We have plenty of water to fight these wildfires, but let’s be clear: It’s our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires,” said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency. He and others said that Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a perennial and unrelated water dispute in California between farmers and environmentalists. Farmers have long argued for more water to be allocated to irrigating crops, while environmentalists counter that the state’s rivers would suffer and fish stocks would die. [For the latest updates on the Mendocino Complex Fire, read this story.] The president first addressed the fires late Sunday, writing on Twitter, “California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized.” He also referred to a debate in forest management about the effectiveness of removing trees and vegetation as a fire control method. On Monday, Mr. Trump expanded on his comments in another tweet, for a second time referring to water being diverted into the ocean. The remarks came hours after the White House declared the wildfires a “major disaster” and ordered that federal funding be made available to help recovery efforts. California does not lack water to fight the Carr Fire and others burning across the state, officials said. Mr. Berlant of Cal Fire declined to speculate on the meaning of Mr. Trump’s statement that water was not being “properly utilized.” Asked about that line and the president’s claim that water was being diverted into the Pacific, a spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown, Evan Westrup, said in an email, “Your guess is as good as mine.” The White House did not respond to requests for clarification on Mr. Trump’s statement. William Stewart, a forestry specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he believed Mr. Trump was referring to the battle over allocating water to irrigation versus providing river habitat for fish. That debate has no bearing on the availability of water for firefighting. Helicopters lower buckets into lakes and ponds to collect water that is then used to douse wildfires, and there is no shortage of water to do so, Cal Fire officials said. California water regulators are preparing to negotiate how much water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta should flow to California’s farms and how much should flow down the river and to the ocean to ensure fish have enough fresh water to spawn and hatch. The issue has long pitted environmentalists against the state’s farming communities. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump took on the farmers’ grievances in language similar to his tweets this week. “You have a water problem that is so insane, it is so ridiculous, where they’re taking the water and shoving it out to sea,” he said during a May 2016 campaign rally in Fresno. “They have farms up here, and they don’t get water.” Recently, California Republicans encouraged the Trump administration to weigh in on the issue, inviting Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to the Central Valley to discuss water rights in the state’s agricultural heartland. “It’s a pretty big story, but it’s got nothing to do with the fires,” Mr. Stewart said. Mr. Trump raised another issue when he wrote that officials “must also tree clear to stop fire spreading.” Scientists and forest experts said the president was referring to a valid and continuing debate. The timber industry has argued that “thinning” forests — removing certain trees to improve the health of the remaining ones and diminish the plants and underbrush that fuel fires — reduces the risk of wildfires. Republicans in Congress have sought to loosen environmental restrictions to allow more thinning. Democrats and environmentalists argue the practice will open the door to expanded commercial logging and threaten wildlife. California already has policies in place to address wildfire risk. LeRoy Westerling, a management professor at the University of California, Merced, who studies wildfires, said that Mr. Trump’s statement about fire-control efforts hit on an important issue, but that he wrongly placed the blame on California. Professor Westerling noted that while federal funding for lowering wildfire risk has been tied up in budget negotiations, California has allocated $256 million this year. That money is coming from a source the Trump administration finds troublesome: revenues from California’s program to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases. Under its market-based approach for curbing carbon emissions, California sets a ceiling for the total amount of carbon that can be emitted. Companies are then required to obtain permits to release carbon into the atmosphere. The Trump administration opposes federal efforts to address climate change. California is “spending millions and millions of dollars on this while the federal government is sitting on its hands,” Professor Westerling said. “And all that money is being raised because we’re putting a price on carbon.” Scientists noted that Mr. Trump’s statement didn’t address the role climate change has played in creating a hotter and drier fire season. The president in the past has dismissed climate change as a hoax and his top cabinet officials have questioned the established science that rising global temperatures are caused by human activity. Michael F. Wehner, a senior staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it was not possible to quantify precisely the likelihood that climate change is having an impact on forest fires, as can now be done with other extreme-weather events such as heat waves. And, he said, it’s not easy to weigh how much of the problem can be laid at the feet of forest-management practices. However, climate change is making summers longer and drier, which expands the wildfire season. “To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” he said. California fire officials on Monday said the Carr Fire in Shasta County had ravaged more than 160,000 acres while the Mendocino Complex fires grew overnight and had charred more than 273,000 acres across Mendocino, Lake and Colusa counties. The White House’s disaster declaration ordered federal funding be made available to help recovery efforts. “Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property loses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,” a White House statement said.","In his first remarks on the vast California wildfires that have killed at least seven people and forced thousands to flee, President Trump blamed the blazes on the state’s environmental policies and inaccurately claimed that water that could be used to fight the fires was “foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” State officials and firefighting experts dismissed the president’s comments, which he posted on Twitter. “We have plenty of water to fight these wildfires, but let’s be clear: It’s our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires,” said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency.","In his first remarks on the vast California wildfires that have killed at least seven people and forced thousands to flee, President Trump blamed the blazes on the state’s environmental policies and inaccurately claimed that water that could be used to fight the fires was “foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” State officials and firefighting experts dismissed the president’s comments, which he posted on Twitter. “We have plenty of water to fight these wildfires, but let’s be clear: It’s our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires,” said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency. . “It’s not fair to say that we are losing water. We have plenty of water in the state of California.” The president’s remarks came as the number of fires in California has surged to nearly 5,000, with more than 1,000 still burning, according to Cal Fire. More than 1,200 structures have been destroyed by the fires, and hundreds of others have been damaged or destroyed. In a series of tweets late Sunday, Mr. Trump suggested that the fires were caused by “massive forest fires” in the state. But the president’s comments were contradicted by other officials in California, who said they had seen no evidence that the fires were linked to climate change. And the governor of California, Jerry Brown, said on Monday that he would not take any steps to cut back on water use, which has been a major focus of his administration. Mr. Brown, who was elected last year after serving as the mayor of Oakland, said he would instead work to improve the state’s infrastructure, including building more roads. “I will not stop fighting the fires until every tree is saved, and we rebuild our roads and bridges,” Mr. Brown said in a statement. “We need to do this for all Californians, not just those in the path of the fires.” The fires began on Friday, prompting Mr. Trump to tweet that he would consider ordering federal aid to help states fight the fires. The president, who has called climate change a “hoax” and vowed to roll back environmental regulations, has yet to make a decision about whether to send federal funds to help fight the fires. Mr. Trump has said he wants to “do everything I can to save lives and property” but has not offered specifics. He has also said that he would consider cutting back on federal funding to states that do not follow the rules. On Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest that he might do something about the fires in California, saying that the country “should do something about it.” “It’s going to be hard to get through this,” Mr. Trump said. “But if you look at what’s happening in California, you see that we’re doing something very quickly.” Mr. Trump said he would consider “all options,” including military action. “I am considering all options,” he said. “We have plenty of time to make a decision.” The fires have destroyed at least 48 homes, and dozens of other structures, including a nursing home, a hospital and a school. Many residents of the area have fled their homes, and the fire has forced tens of thousands of people to seek shelter in schools and shelters. The cause of the fires remains unclear. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for parts of Los Angeles County on Sunday, saying that the water level was expected to rise by about 10 feet by Tuesday morning. But the forecast was later revised downward, and the warning was lifted. At least one person was reported dead in the fire, and two others were hospitalized. At least two people were reported missing, and a third was injured. There were reports of looting in several areas of the county, and some residents said they feared arson. The fires have taken a heavy toll on the region’s economy, as well as its tourism industry, which draws millions of visitors each year. The Los Angeles Times reported on Monday that the city of Long Beach had lost $1 billion in revenue because of the fires. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said that the department had recovered $2.8 million in damage from the fires. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said that it had recovered $6.5 million in damage from the fires. The Los Angeles Police Department said that it had recovered $3.6 million in damage from the fires. The L.A. County Fire District said that it had recovered $1.3 million in damage from the fires.

"Too often television news, especially on cable, serves as a megaphone for politicians who use it to forward lies and propaganda while so effortlessly ignoring questions they’re supposedly there to answer. But every now and then, there are those happy exceptions. One came at precisely 4:01 p.m. on Tuesday. That was when the CNN anchor Jake Tapper began asking Vice President-elect Mike Pence about connections between the Trump transition team and Michael G. Flynn, the son of the incoming national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn. The younger Mr. Flynn had recently used Twitter to legitimize the false story that the Clintons and their allies were running a child sex trafficking ring out of the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor in Washington. He did so hours after a man stormed the place with an AR-15 assault rifle in search of the nonexistent sex ring. (A week later I still have to ask, did I really just write that sentence?) That morning, Mr. Pence had said on the MSNBC show “Morning Joe” that the younger Mr. Flynn had “no involvement in the transition whatsoever,” and that was that. But, it turned out, the younger Mr. Flynn was in fact aiding his father on the transition — at least until later that day, when President-elect Donald J. Trump put an end to it. And, CNN was reporting, the transition team had even sought to get Mr. Flynn’s son a security clearance, for access to sensitive information. When Mr. Tapper asked Mr. Pence whether he was aware of the security clearance request, Mr. Pence dodged. “I’m aware in talking to General Flynn that his son was helping with scheduling,” he said. “But you put in for security clearance for him,” Mr. Tapper said. “He was helping his dad,” Mr. Pence said, “but that’s no longer the case.” And so it went eight times, as Mr. Tapper repeated the question and Mr. Pence accused him of pursuing “a distraction” and tried to change the subject. “I want to move on to other issues,” Mr. Tapper told him, “but I’m afraid I just didn’t get an answer.” Mr. Tapper called it an example of how he had been trying to “draw basic lines about truth and decency and trying to get answers to questions.” As such, it was an object lesson in what doing it right looks like. At the same time, it was all very basic, what reporters are supposed to do: Ask questions of people in power and insist on answers. But it bounced around the internet as a shining example of stand-up journalism, because, unfortunately, such moments now seem so rare — especially in a year marked by Matt Lauer’s soft interview of Mr. Trump at NBC’s “Commander in Chief” forum in September, and CNN’s own lapses with hires like the Trump aide Corey Lewandowski. If only such moments could stop being so special and start being normal. Television news is going to have to do its part should Mr. Trump and his administration try to make policy based on false assertions, the same way he used them on the campaign trail. (And, yes, television will have to be just as vigilant should Mr. Trump’s opponents use falsehoods to fight him, too.) The same holds for all of the news media, of course. But live television can be a safe harbor for falsehood and deflection. It’s easy for me to criticize as a columnist who has time to analyze and fact-check before writing. On television, in real time, even the best-prepared interviewers may have neither the time nor the facts to catch a lie and call it out. Even when they do, their attempts to call foul can turn into stalemates if the interviewee insists on continuing to forward something that’s false or unsubstantiated, which seems to be the latest craze (see Reince Priebus, millions of illegal votes, “Face the Nation”). But, as Mr. Tapper told me, in this “year in which basic facts and basic decency are at risk, persistence is important at the end of the day.” It can mean losing bookings and therefore ratings, given that politicians who face real grilling may be inclined to avoid the kitchens that cooked them — a risk worth taking. Hillary Clinton did not grant Mr. Tapper another interview after a sit-down in early June, when he asked her if questions about her family foundation undermined her criticism of Mr. Trump’s. (In an email, divulged by WikiLeaks, the Clinton adviser John Podesta once called Mr. Tapper a word for the male anatomy not suitable for print.) And Mr. Trump never came back after his interview with Mr. Tapper in June, when the anchor tried 23 separate times to get a direct answer about his comments regarding the Mexican heritage of the judge in the civil case against Trump University. Mr. Tapper said some of his competitors, whom he did not name, had gone easy on interview subjects to ensure future access. “We’re not supposed to be providing people in power with safe spaces,” he said. Mr. Tapper did not invent the tough interview. George Stephanopoulos and Martha Raddatz of ABC, Chuck Todd of NBC, Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly of Fox News, and John Dickerson of CBS have all had their moments. And none has yet claimed the mantles of Tim Russert and Ted Koppel, feared interviewers who combined tough styles with incomparable levels of preparation. You can only imagine how Mr. Russert would have handled Katrina Pierson, the Trump campaign’s national spokeswoman, when she incorrectly asserted on CNN that it was President Obama who invaded Afghanistan, or what short work Mr. Koppel would have made of Mr. Lewandowski in August when he repeated the tired fake claim that Mr. Obama wasn’t born here. Then again, you would have to wonder whether they would have booked such interview subjects — or hired them — in the first place. CNN was host to such nonsense enough that Karen Tumulty of The Washington Post felt compelled to ask Jeffrey A. Zucker, CNN’s president, at a panel discussion  two weeks ago, “At what point do you say, ‘You can’t come on our air anymore’?” In an interview with me on Friday, Mr. Zucker defended those appearances by saying that they represented Mr. Trump’s worldview, and that his anchors were there to keep them honest and did. For all the criticism CNN has received, it did introduce more aggressive fact-checking into its reportage, including using onscreen banners known as chyrons to note when something was false, which all networks will hopefully use more frequently. Going forward into the Trump era, Mr. Zucker said, “the key for us” will be “to make sure that we hold the administration’s feet to the fire, hold them accountable — not presuppose that anything is wrong or bad, but not be intimidated and not be afraid to call things out.” He pointed to the recent flare-up involving the CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny — a former New York Times colleague — who said Mr. Trump’s claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally was “blatant and baseless,” which prompted a Twitter tirade from the president-elect. The spirit seems to be going around. On Sunday, Mr. Todd persistently pressed Mr. Priebus on “Meet the Press” about allegations that Russia meddled in the election. The week before, when Mr. Pence told Mr. Stephanopoulos that Mr. Trump’s claim about illegal voting was “refreshing,” Mr. Stephanopoulos said, “Why is it refreshing to make false statements?” The tête-à-tête earned Mr. Stephanopoulos a mock honor, “The Crapcatcher Award,” from the “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah, who also gave one to Mr. Tapper. Real progress will come when solid and uncompromising television journalism doesn’t need to be recognized with trophies. The times demand it. Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Monday with the Mediator column, about rare examples of tough questions on TV news, misstated, in some copies, the given name of a CNN anchor. As the article correctly noted, he is Jake Tapper, not Jack. The column also misstated, in some copies, the month Mr. Tapper conducted his last interview with Hillary Clinton. It was in early June, not in May.","Too often television news, especially on cable, serves as a megaphone for politicians who use it to forward lies and propaganda while so effortlessly ignoring questions they’re supposedly there to answer.

But every now and then, there are those happy exceptions. . In the case of Donald J. Trump, the president-elect, the network has been one of them. On Wednesday night, CNN aired an hourlong special that, in a way, did not need to be aired. It was a rare moment of candor from a network that has long been known for its political bias. “The truth is that we don’t know what happened,” said CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was in Washington to cover the inauguration of President Trump. “We have no idea why he got elected. We have no idea why he became president. We have no idea why he’s a billionaire.” The special was an hourlong interview with Mr. Trump by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who had previously interviewed him for an episode of “New Day” on HBO. The special, called “The Briefing,” was a chance to discuss his campaign and the transition period leading up to the election. The president-elect, who was interviewed by CNN’s Jim Clancy, appeared at times to be more forthcoming than his advisers, who have insisted that he has not spoken about the transition period, saying only that he was “very excited” about being president. But the special also offered a window into the mind of someone who has spent his life trying to prove that he is fit to be president. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, told CNN that Mr. Trump had never discussed the transition period, but he did say that he would “love to” talk about it if the president-elect was willing. “I’m sure he will,” Mr. Giuliani said. “He’s very excited about it. He’s very excited about everything.” The special was a striking example of how the network’s political bias is not limited to its anchors. It was also a reminder that the network’s commitment to political correctness runs much deeper than just its anchors. A former CNN anchor, John King, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that the network’s decision to air the special was “a perfect example of how the network has become complicit in the culture wars,” and that it was “a disgrace to our democracy.” Mr. King said that Mr. Trump’s campaign, which had been criticized for its “unfairness,” was “the most dishonest campaign I’ve ever seen.” And he said that Mr. Trump’s remarks about the size of the crowd at his inauguration were “garbage.” “I can’t believe that this network would allow itself to be used as a platform for such garbage,” Mr. King wrote. “It’s beyond embarrassing.” Mr. Trump himself did not respond to requests for comment. But he has repeatedly denied that he has ever said anything derogatory about African-Americans or Jews. He has said that his campaign was “unfair” and that he would be “great” to debate Hillary Clinton. But he has also said that he does not support Israel’s right to exist and that he would be “great” to debate Barack Obama. He has said that he does not believe in evolution, but that he would debate Bill O’Reilly. But he has also said that he would debate Ted Cruz. And he has said that he would debate Bernie Sanders. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Marco Rubio, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who is a Republican running for re-election. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who is a Republican running for re-election. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who is a Republican running for re-election. The network has also said that it would be great to debate Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is a Republican running for re -election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Tim Pawlenty  of Minnesota, who is a Republican running for re-election. And it has said that it would be great to debate Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is a Republican running for re-election. But the group’s leader, Rick Wilson, said he did not think that the other candidates were ready for prime time. “I don’t know why they haven’t been asked yet,” Mr. Wilson said. “It’s probably because they’re trying to figure out how to do their job. They’re trying to figure out how to get people excited about the campaign.” The group’s leaders have said that they want to make sure that the debates are as interesting as possible. But they have also said that they have to make sure that the candidates are prepared to answer questions and that the moderators are well versed in the issues. “If you’re going to be asking these questions, you have to know what you’re talking about,” said David Axelrod, the former adviser to President Barack Obama. “You have to know the context. You have to know the history. You have to know the political context.” Mr. Axelrod said that if the debates were held on Sunday evenings, he would be there, but he was not sure that the format would work. “I’m not sure we could get the audience,” he said. “We’d probably get a lot of people who are just going to be bored.” Mr. Ryan has said that he would like to debate the president, but he has said that he does not believe that he is ready. He has said that he has never been on a debate stage before. Mr. Pawlenty has said that he would like to debate the president, but he has said that he does not believe that he is ready.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s threat to rip up the Iran nuclear deal has touched off an urgent scramble in European capitals to preserve the agreement — not by rewriting it, but by creating a successor deal intended to halt Iran’s ballistic missile program and make permanent the restrictions on its ability to produce nuclear fuel. As the two sides prepare to meet for trans-Atlantic talks next month in Berlin, the Europeans are demanding a guarantee that Mr. Trump will abide by the add-on deal after it is negotiated and not jettison it on some other pretext. Mr. Trump has called the 2015 agreement that was negotiated by President Barack Obama “the worst deal” ever and has told Britain, France and Germany to fix it by May 12 or he will pull the United States out. The Iranians have so far dismissed efforts by the State Department to impose strict new terms on Tehran — or face threats of renewed sanctions if it fails to comply — as a backdoor effort to reopen the original agreement that limits Iran’s nuclear program. The European demand comes under duress. Talking points that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson recently circulated to American diplomats in Europe warned that “in the absence of a clear commitment from your side to address these issues, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.” The instructions, which were shown to The New York Times, stipulate that the Europeans agree to three key fixes: a commitment to renegotiate limits on missile testing by Iran; an assurance that inspectors have unfettered access to Iranian military bases; and an extension of the deal’s expiration dates to prevent Iran from resuming the production of nuclear fuel long after the current restrictions expire in 2030. European diplomats said there was scope for an agreement on missiles and inspections, but not yet on the length of the deal. They argue that rewriting those terms would break the bargain they struck, not only with Iran but also with Russia and China, two other signatories. And breaching the deal, they say, would free Iran to pursue nuclear weapons again. The upcoming talks are being led by Brian H. Hook, a low-key Republican lawyer who is the State Department’s director of policy planning, who has said he would bring the European request for a guarantee back to Washington. European diplomats said they worry that Mr. Trump’s scorn for the deal runs so deep that he would find other reasons to pull out. Last month, he warned that the accord “is under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time.” Even if Mr. Trump did pledge to abide by the deal, it is far from clear that a successor deal would be endorsed by Russia or China, let alone the Iranians, who signaled in recent weeks that they are planning a new project — a fleet of nuclear-powered ships, fueled by Iranian-made reactors — that they say would justify resuming the production of nuclear fuel as the limits imposed by the deal expire over the next dozen years. Still, the mere fact that the United States and Europe are trying to work out a compromise attests to the desire, on both sides, to find a solution that would satisfy Mr. Trump while not unraveling the deal. The president’s national security team — Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster — has on three occasions talked him out of ripping up the deal. With each deadline to reimpose sanctions on Iran, that task gets harder. There is an element of diplomatic legerdemain to the exercise, European diplomats acknowledge: How do you convince Mr. Trump that you have changed the deal without actually changing it? “The supplemental deal is a diplomatic device that is being used to allow the Europeans to declare victory,” said Mark Dubowitz, a leading critic of the Iran deal who is nevertheless open to the idea. “They can say they were able to keep the deal, remain steadfast to their commitment not to renegotiate it, but also to satisfy the U.S. and their own concerns that the length of the deal was too short,” said Mr. Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. By law, Mr. Trump must decide every 120 days whether to continue suspending longstanding American economic sanctions against Tehran, which the United States committed to lift as part of the deal. If he were to reimpose them, as he has threatened, that would effectively scuttle the deal. Iran complains that Mr. Trump’s threats have already kept European banks from investing in major projects in Iran, denying it the benefits that were promised for giving up its enrichment program. “If the same policy of confusion and uncertainties over the future of the deal continue,” Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, who was a member of the negotiating team, said last week, “if companies and banks are not working with Iran, we cannot remain in a deal that has no benefit for us.” The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week that it had received formal notice from Tehran about a “decision that has been taken to construct naval nuclear propulsion in future.” Nothing in the 2015 agreement prohibits the construction of nuclear reactors to power ships and submarines, and those reactors would almost certainly not use nuclear-weapons-grade fuel. But they could provide a pretext for Iran to resume uranium enrichment. The Europeans are most comfortable with enforcing new limits on Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing. Missiles are not covered by the nuclear accord, but rather by a United Nations resolution, whose wording was negotiated by then-Secretary of State John Kerry just as the nuclear accord was coming together in Vienna in July 2015. The State Department’s talking points said the United States viewed the nuclear and missile programs as “inseparable,” and said that “Iran’s development and testing of missiles should be subject to severe sanctions.” The Europeans have not gone that far, at least yet. Inspections are potentially more problematic, given the administration’s rejection of arguments by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that all military-related sites are off limits to international inspectors. But this has not been an issue yet: The inspections have been limited to declared nuclear sites, and the United Nations nuclear agency affirmed last week that it had been given all the access it sought. Inspectors have said they would try to inspect military sites only if they had intelligence suggesting that surreptitious nuclear activity was underway. Once a deal is struck with the Europeans, administration officials intend to seek approval from Russia, China and Iran. But concerns that such a deal could not possibly pass muster with Iran will not deter them, a senior official said. Russia and China’s lack of participation would also matter little, given the stark consequences for Iran’s economy if Europe and the United States reimpose sanctions, this person said. While American and European negotiators are working feverishly on a deal to preserve the 2015 accord, there are also preliminary discussions about what will happen if they fall short. Reimposing sanctions, such as blacklisting the Central Bank of Iran, would cause serious problems for European companies, potentially precipitating a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance. But the president, Mr. Dubowitz noted, has the authority to phase in sanctions, which he could use as leverage to give negotiators more time to work out an agreement. He could, for example, impose sanctions on the central bank for its support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is accused of supporting terrorism, but waive the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions on foreign companies that do business with the bank until the next deadline in July. For the Europeans, who are mostly satisfied with the deal and face no domestic political pressure to pull out, there is little joy in this exercise. But they feel they have no choice but to go along with it. One diplomat compared it to humoring an angry relative who controlled a family vacation estate, and periodically threatened to burn it down.","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s threat to rip up the Iran nuclear deal has touched off an urgent scramble in European capitals to preserve the agreement — not by rewriting it, but by creating a successor deal intended to halt Iran’s ballistic missile program and make permanent the restrictions on its ability to produce nuclear fuel.

The Europeans fear that if the United States pulls out of the deal, they will be left with no way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. But the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said Sunday that the United States could not unilaterally withdraw from the deal without first seeking European approval. “The European Union is very clear that we have to take this step together,” Ms. Mogherini told reporters in Brussels. “We are going to follow the path of the United States and the European Union, and we are going to do everything we can to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.” In an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that Mr. Trump would need to show that he was willing to accept the terms of the new deal, which he called “an embarrassment to the United States.” “I think there’s a lot of skepticism about whether this is even possible,” Mr. Graham said. “If he doesn’t believe it’s possible, then I think he’d have to go back to the drawing board.” Mr. Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal could embolden Iranian leaders who see the United States as a friend and ally in their quest to build a bomb. “The Iranians are now more emboldened than ever to pursue their nuclear ambitions,” said John J. Ensign Jr., a former top State Department official under President Barack Obama. “They know that the Americans are going to come after them.” In recent days, Mr. Trump has shown little inclination to change course. He has vowed to keep the Iran deal, which was reached between Iran and six world powers, in place. And he has repeatedly insisted that the United States cannot renegotiate the terms of the deal. But he has also promised to negotiate a replacement agreement with the Europeans. On Sunday, he appeared to shift gears, saying in a Twitter post: “The Iran Deal will remain in place until such time as I deem it appropriate to change it!” Mr. Trump’s threat to tear up the deal — which the president signed on July 14 — has been met with stiff resistance from European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has said she would never allow the United States to leave the deal. But the Europeans are preparing for a fight. They are already plotting how to replace the deal, which has been described as “the worst deal ever” and “the most catastrophic deal in history.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said Sunday that the United States must first seek European approval before withdrawing from the deal. “The European Union is very clear that we have to take this step together,” Ms. Mogherini said. “We are going to follow the path of the United States and the European Union, and we are going to do everything we can to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.” Ms. Mogherini’s comments came as Mr. Trump and his aides were preparing to hold a meeting with European officials in Washington on Monday to discuss what steps to take to salvage the deal. It is unclear whether the European leaders would be willing to commit to keeping the deal, which is supposed to last for 120 days. Mr. Trump has said he will not renegotiate the terms of the deal, but he has hinted at the possibility of doing so. Mr. Trump has also indicated that he might consider leaving the deal, but he has not yet outlined what that would entail. Mr. Trump has said that he wants to stay in the deal because it is important to him personally. But he has also suggested that he might want to renegotiate the terms. Mr. Trump and his advisers are expected to discuss the future of the deal, and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal, during the meeting with European officials. The United States has long sought to reassure Europe that it would not leave the deal, but the Europeans have grown increasingly concerned that the United States will not honor its commitments. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said  Sunday that the United States cannot unilaterally withdraw from the deal without first seeking European approval. “The European Union is very clear that we have to take this step together,” Ms. Mogherini said. “We are going to follow the path of the United States and the European Union, and we are going to do everything we can to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.” In an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that Mr . Trump was “not going to be able to pull out of the agreement,” adding that he would have to get European leaders to approve any unilateral withdrawal. “If you want to leave it up to the Europeans, then you will be left with no deal at all,” Mr. Graham said. “You’re going to have to go back to the drawing board. You’re going to have to come up with something else.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the deal is “the worst deal ever” and that it “will never work.” But his administration has said that the deal would be better than nothing. The president has also said that the deal would be good for America and that it would help curb Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Trump has said that he wants to renegotiate the terms of the deal, but has not offered specifics. Mr. Trump has suggested that Iran could remain in the deal if it were willing to make concessions, such as reducing its uranium stockpile, which could be used for fuel. But that is unlikely. The Obama-era agreement allows Iran to keep some of the plutonium it has already produced. And the United States and European powers are expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss what to do next. The White House has been reluctant to offer details about how the United States would exit the deal. But a senior administration official said on Sunday that the United States would be leaving the deal if Iran did not make concessions. “We’re going to be leaving the deal if they don’t make some changes,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks had yet to begin. “We’re not going to be leaving the deal if they don’t make some changes.” The president has repeatedly said that he would not negotiate a new deal with Iran. He has also said that he would not accept a deal that includes sanctions relief. The administration has said that it would consider additional sanctions relief only if Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program. The president has said that he would consider those sanctions relief only if Iran agreed to cut back on its ballistic missile tests and other military exercises. Mr. Trump has said that he would not accept a deal that included sanctions relief. “I’m not going to be part of a deal that doesn’t include sanctions relief,” he said last week. “It’s a bad deal for our country, and I’m not going to be part of a deal that doesn’t include sanctions relief.” But the administration has said that it would consider additional sanctions relief only if Iran agreed to cut back on its ballistic missile tests and other military exercises.

"Since the revolt by parents against New York State’s reading and math tests last year, education officials at the state level have been bending over backward to try to show that they are listening to parents’ and educators’ concerns. The tests, which are given to third through eighth graders and will begin this year on April 5, were shortened, time limits were removed, and the results will not be a factor in teacher evaluations, among other changes. On Monday, Betty A. Rosa, the newly elected chancellor of the Board of Regents and the state’s highest education official, even said that if she had children of testing age, she would have them sit out the exams. The message, clearly, is: We hear you. But in New York City, the Education Department seems to be sending a different message to some teachers and principals: Watch what you say. At a forum in December, Anita Skop, the superintendent of District 15 in Brooklyn, which had the highest rate of test refusals in the city last year, said that for an educator to encourage opting out was a political act and that public employees were barred from using their positions to make political statements. On March 7, the teachers at Public School 234 in TriBeCa, where only two students opted out last year, emailed the school’s parents a broadside against the tests. The email said the exams hurt “every single class of students across the school” because of the resources they consumed. But 10 days later, when dozens of parents showed up for a PTA meeting where they expected to hear more about the tests, the teachers were nowhere to be seen. The school’s principal explained that “it didn’t feel safe” for them to speak, adding that their union had informed them that their email could be considered insubordination. The principal, Lisa Ripperger, introduced an official from the Education Department who was there to “help oversee our meeting.” Several principals said they had been told by either the schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, or their superintendents that they and their teachers should not encourage opting out. There were no specific consequences mentioned, but the warnings were enough to deter some educators. Devora Kaye, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said that teachers were free to express themselves on matters of public concern as private citizens, but not as representatives of the department, and that if they crossed that line they could be disciplined. Asked what the disciplinary measures might be, Ms. Kaye said they were determined case by case. “I don’t think that the teachers’ putting themselves in the middle of it is a good idea,” Ms. Fariña said in an interview. A fifth of the state’s students sat out either the reading or the math tests last year, though New York City’s opt-out rate was less than 2 percent. Despite the state’s efforts at placating them, many parents and educators are still angry about the tests. They complain about the time and money schools must devote to preparing for, administering and scoring the exams and the limited information they get from them, as well as raising broader philosophical objections to testing. The state’s position appears to be in flux. The previous Regents chancellor, Merryl H. Tisch, was a strong proponent of the tests. Last year, while Dr. Tisch was still in office, the education commissioner, MaryEllen Elia, who reports to the Regents, said that it was “unethical” for educators to encourage or support test refusal and that it was districts’ responsibility to make sure that as many students as possible took the exams this spring. But the election of Dr. Rosa, who was endorsed by leaders of the opt-out movement, has muddied the issue. Jonathan Burman, a spokesman for the state’s Education Department said this week that the decision about whether to take the tests was up to parents, but that the state wanted to make sure that parents and educators knew the ways the tests had been improved, “so they can make an informed decision.” The state did not take action against any teachers or principals who advocated opting out last year. Still, Ms. Fariña seems to be taking Ms. Elia’s call to minimize the number of children who do not sit for the tests very seriously. In the interview, she said that her policy was not to suppress discussions about the tests within schools, but that she felt “any conversations have to be balanced, because in the past it was more of the opt-out movement.” Asked how schools could engineer balanced conversations, she said that parents were “very good at researching things” and that a conversation could consist of parents’ explaining why they were or were not having their children take the tests. While some parents have said they want to hear from the city why they should have their children take the tests, Ms. Fariña said that, generally, “I just think that what I’m hearing is that parents want more permission to opt out.” At Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, part of District 15, more than a third of the eligible students did not sit for the tests last year, and the principal, Elizabeth Phillips, has in the past been outspoken in opposing them. At a PTA meeting there last week, Ms. Phillips was studiedly neutral, but several teachers criticized the tests, with one comparing the stand against them to abolitionism and the fight for same-sex marriage. Afterward, Ms. Phillips said she felt the teachers had expressed “displeasure with many things about the state tests,” but had not advocated opting out. “We’ve met as a staff, and the teachers know that is not the role of a teacher,” she said. Ms. Fariña was the superintendent of District 15 from 2001 to 2003. It is a largely middle-class district, where children have generally done well on the exams. Two Education Department employees, who did not want to be identified because they were afraid of losing their jobs, said that in the last year, Ms. Fariña had described the district as complacent about its academic performance. Her spokeswoman denied that she had done so, saying she had great respect for the principals and families in the district. In an earlier interview, Ms. Fariña said she was not surprised that District 15 had the most parents refuse the test. “They’ve always been a district that has a lot of parents who have very strong opinions,” she said. “What can I tell you?”","Since the revolt by parents against New York State’s reading and math tests last year, education officials at the state level have been bending over backward to try to show that they are listening to parents’ and educators’ concerns.

But the state’s schools chancellor, Thomas A. Spota, has said that he is open to making changes if it helps students learn more effectively. “We want to find out what works best for our kids,” Mr. Spota said in an interview. “But we also want to do everything we can to make sure that our kids are learning the way they need to learn.” In recent years, Mr. Spota has been criticized for his unwillingness to listen to teachers, who often say they would rather have the test scores in their classrooms than in the hands of administrators. In one case, he even suggested that the state should take away the test from some school districts because they had too many students failing the state’s tests. “If you have a lot of kids failing the test, then you can’t really evaluate them,” he said. “You’re going to have to rely on your own judgment.” Mr. Spota, who was appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, has said that he is open to making changes to the tests, but he has also said that he does not believe that the state should be changing its testing practices. He has said that the state should be focusing on improving the quality of instruction. “We have a responsibility to make sure that our kids are learning the way they need to learn,” he said. “We have a responsibility to ensure that every student is ready to learn.” Mr. Spota said that he was not concerned about the state’s test scores because they were already so high. “I don’t think there’s any question about the fact that we’ve got a very high-performing school system in New York State,” he said. “We have a lot of kids who are ahead of where we’d like them to be.” The state’s superintendent, James P. Kelleher, said that he was open to making changes to the tests, but he did not think that the state should be changing its testing practices. “I think it’s important for us to continue to improve the quality of instruction,” he said. “We have a responsibility to ensure that every student is ready to learn.” The state’s testing policy, known as the Common Core Standards, was adopted in 2010 and requires that all schools use the same set of assessments. The state’s superintendent, John S. King Jr., said that he did not see how changing the testing policy would help students learn better. “I don’t think there’s any question that we have a very high-performing school system in New York State,” he said. “We have a lot of kids who are ahead of where we’d like them to be.” Mr. King said that he would look into whether the state should change the testing policy. He said that he had not heard from anyone from the governor’s office since the controversy began. Mr. Spota said that he was not worried about the state’s test scores because he thought that they were already so high. “I think we’ve got a very good system in New York State,” he said. “I’m not concerned about the score,” he added. “I’m concerned about the way that we teach.” The state’s Department of Education has been trying to sell the idea of changing the testing policy since last summer, when Mr. Spota was asked by reporters whether he would consider changing the testing policy. “We’re not changing the testing policy,” he said. “We’re not changing the assessment policy. We’re not changing the accountability policy.” Mr. Spota said that he believed that the state should be focused on improving the quality of instruction. “We have a responsibility to ensure that every student is ready to learn,” he said. “We have a responsibility to ensure that every child is prepared to learn.” Mr. Spota said that he had not heard from the governor’s office since the controversy began.

He said that he had not heard from the governor’s office since the controversy began. Mr . Cuomo said he would consider changing the policy if it was “in the best interest of our children.” The governor has said that he would not change the testing policy because he believes that it is “unfair” for schools to be able to test students without their permission. Mr. King said that he did not believe that the state should change the testing policy because he does not think that the current system is fair. “It’s unfair,” he said. “It’s just wrong.” Mr. King said that he would look into whether the state should change the testing policy.

"A Southwest Airlines flight scheduled to leave Louisville, Ky., on Wednesday morning was evacuated on the runway after a passenger’s Samsung cellphone caught fire, passengers and the airline said. Southwest said in a statement that passengers and airline employees were taken off Flight 994, which was scheduled to leave for Baltimore, after a customer reported “smoke emitting from a Samsung electronic device.” The Verge identified the passenger as Brian Green and his phone as “a replacement Galaxy Note 7.” A Samsung spokeswoman said in a statement on Wednesday that the company was unable to immediately confirm which device was involved in the episode. “We are working with the authorities and Southwest now to recover the device and confirm the cause,” the statement said. “Once we have examined the device, we will have more information to share.” The company, which is the world’s largest smartphone maker, announced last month that it would replace 2.5 million of the smartphone model because of a flaw in the battery’s cell that could result in the devices bursting into flames or exploding. Mr. Green told The Verge that he had picked up the new phone on Sept. 21, after the recall. The episode could be damaging for the company, because the replacement devices were thought to be safe. The new models had been approved by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, which on Wednesday said it was investigating the episode. In a statement, the commission chairman, Elliot F. Kaye, encouraged owners of the smartphone to turn it off and immediately participate in the recall. He also said staff members had reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration, Samsung and Mr. Green, noting that the agency is “moving expeditiously to investigate this incident.” Christine Sundman, 65, a retired teacher who was planning to return home to New Hampshire after visiting her daughter’s family in Louisville, was one of the passengers evacuated from the flight. She said that a woman sitting near the phone’s owner had told her that the device had just been powered down when it caught fire. The owner quickly dropped the device on the floor, Mrs. Sundman said in a phone interview. Mrs. Sundman said she had been sitting in the seventh row of the plane and did not notice any commotion until a flight attendant rushed to the front to consult with her colleague. As they exchanged urgent whispers, Mrs. Sundman said, “I did hear the word ‘smoke.’ ” The two flight attendants went into the cockpit, Mrs. Sundman said, and within seconds the captain came out and calmly told passengers that the plane had to be evacuated. She said he did not need to use the loudspeaker to make his voice heard. As the passengers disembarked, the smell of smoke began to permeate the plane. “I did not see any of the passengers lose control,” Mrs. Sundman said. “One woman was kind of buzzing around a lot, but nobody lost control. The airline was working as hard as it could.” Mrs. Sundman said the passengers were eventually told that a hole had burned through the floor. After about two hours, she said, the flight was canceled and passengers were allowed back on the plane to recover their baggage. “This could have happened moments after we took off, or in the air,” she said. “It could have been catastrophic.” Earlier this year, Qantas  banned Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from its flights because of instances in which they caught fire when business-class passengers dropped their devices into the electronically activated seats, crushing the phone and damaging the battery. Air France also said it had several in-flight smoke or fire events that were set off in the same way. The Federal Aviation Administration strongly urged owners not to use the phones on planes, before the recall was ordered.","A Southwest Airlines flight scheduled to leave Louisville, Ky., on Wednesday morning was evacuated on the runway after a passenger’s Samsung cellphone caught fire, passengers and the airline said.

"The handsome Washington townhouse where Wayne Hickory practices orthodontics is a landmark of terrorism in America. In 1919, an anarchist exploded a bomb at what was then the home of the attorney general. The failed assassination set off a wave of violent raids on radicals, Communists and leftists, and the deportation without due process of hundreds of innocent European immigrants — a high point of hysteria in an era known as the first Red Scare. “Maybe there is something to learn from history,” Dr. Hickory said in a sitting room that now contains advertising for invisible braces. But asked about Donald J. Trump’s call to bar Muslims from entering the United States, Dr. Hickory said that, as implausible as it was, the proposal had prompted a necessary discussion about whether travelers from countries fraught with Islamic extremism should receive increased scrutiny. “Perhaps,” he said, “the line needs to be drawn a little bit more severely.” An existential fear of foreign infiltration, unfamiliar minorities and terrorist attacks is not a new feeling in America. Neither is the nativist, if at times innovative, language that Mr. Trump has mastered on his way to leading the Republican presidential primary race. But interviews this week with dozens of American voters, even those who do not support Mr. Trump and reject his ban as an indecent proposal, make clear that their anxiety is on the rise in a climate more fearful than at any time since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. From the Capitol to the campaign trail, from Mr. Trump’s childhood neighborhood to the suburbs near the Islamic State-inspired killing of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., voters acknowledged, almost despite themselves, the gnawing sense of insecurity that has fueled Mr. Trump’s vision and persistent appeal. People are seeing things, and saying things. Carol Shapiro, 73, a vehement critic of Mr. Trump from Rockaway, N.J., recalled with some embarrassment her surveillance of an apparently Middle Eastern man wearing a “Taliban hat” and photographing the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree on the day of the terrorist attacks in Paris. “The tree wasn’t lighted,” she said, making her wonder why the man would be taking pictures. “And then he put his hands in his pockets and walked off very fast, and it made me uncomfortable.” Critics of Mr. Trump in Jamaica Estates, Queens, where he grew up, had fewer reservations about expressing their fear of Muslims. “Terrorists can do so many things to hide to get into this country,” said Leonidez Galan, 66, who was actually drawn closer to Mr. Trump and away from his previous choice, Jeb Bush, when Mr. Trump called to ban Muslim immigrants from the United States. Expressing fear of the women in hijabs who walked the neighborhood’s curved streets, he said of Muslims, “They come in and kill people.” Some in the neighborhood who voted for President Obama and planned to support Hillary Clinton nevertheless said they admired Mr. Trump’s machismo and shared his concern that, as Andrew Baker, 53, put it, “Muslims are more dangerous.” Echoes of that notion reverberated on the campaign trail and at the events of candidates who condemned Mr. Trump’s harsh language. Often, it seemed that older voters were bothered most by the attack in San Bernardino and more sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s proposals. At an event for Senator Marco Rubio on Thursday in Iowa City, Arleigh Clemens, 78, a retired construction worker from North Liberty, Iowa, used a mathematical analogy. “Let’s say you have a jar with 10,000 M&Ms, and only 10 of them are poisoned,” he said. “Would you eat them?” At an event in New Hampshire, supporters of Mr. Bush, who has excoriated Mr. Trump’s proposed ban despite his own call for a religious test for refugees from Syria, had views more sympathetic to Mr. Trump. “I just feel we have enough illegal people in our country, and there’s no jobs for them,” said Beverly Lee, 78, of Brookline, N.H. She said she thought the ban was a “good idea.” Beverly Swanburg, 73, from Milford, N.H., agreed. “We should not let any more in, any more immigrants from Mexico or Muslim,” she said, adding that Mr. Trump’s proposal was “on the right road” because of the difficulty in discerning which Muslims were peaceful and which were not, like the couple in San Bernardino. They “went to the shooting range the day before,” she said. “Somebody there should have looked at them as Muslims at a shooting range and paid a little more attention.” In several polls this week, a majority of American voters said they disapproved of Mr. Trump’s plan, even as support for his candidacy continued to rise. But in a New York Times/CBS News poll, 59 percent of Americans also said they were “very concerned” about the threat of terrorism from people entering the United States, and 26 percent said they were “somewhat concerned.” Furtan Yusfa, a mother of two and a Muslim, has been among those experiencing the effects of those fears. “I sometimes feel it, like I’m different from others,” said Ms. Yusfa, 24, who was wearing a hijab, or head scarf, in a mall in Edina, a suburb of Minneapolis. “Sometimes, they’re scared of me.” A century ago, it would have been Mr. Trump’s German immigrant grandparents who felt the brunt of such profiling. Fears of sabotage during World War I raised suspicion, and Americans started saying “liberty cabbage” instead of sauerkraut.  “It was that they could be spies,” said Alexander Keyssar, a history professor at Harvard. “They could be infiltrating.” Those lingering concerns flared again in World War II, when Mr. Trump’s father began telling people he was of Swedish heritage. Japanese-Americans had no such recourse, and many ended up in internment camps. Historians said Mr. Trump was a modern version of the public figures who took advantage of immigrant-based, and more economic-based, fears. Those worries have coursed through American history at least since the Know-Nothing Party of the 19th century demonized waves of Roman Catholic immigrants as operatives of a foreign pope. But even among some who acknowledged Mr. Trump’s appeal, there was a conscious effort not to give in to it. Sipping a caramel coffee at the Edina mall, Brian Wagenaar, a 21-year-old college student, called Mr. Trump’s proposal “ridiculous” but said xenophobic sentiments were natural. “It doesn’t feel great. We’ve been conditioned to know that that’s wrong,” he said. “We all have to safeguard against an inner Trump.” Darlene Linares, 19, a supporter of the Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders in San Bernardino, the site of last week’s massacre, was resigned to the inevitability of such attacks and appalled by Mr. Trump, saying she found his remarks about Mexicans and Muslims disqualifying. That said, Ms. Linares added that her mother, who immigrated from El Salvador in 1995, was on board with Mr. Trump. “My mom actually agrees,” she said. “She thinks that Muslims are all the same.”","The handsome Washington townhouse where Wayne Hickory practices orthodontics is a landmark of terrorism in America.

In 1919, an anarchist exploded a bomb at what was then the home of the attorney general. of New York, and a local police officer was killed. The explosion left the entire block destroyed, and the house itself badly damaged. But the most recent bombing, which occurred on Tuesday night, has been linked to a different kind of terrorist attack: the one that took place in January in the basement of a mosque in Brussels, Belgium, during the Paris attacks. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, saying it was carried out by “a suicide bomber” who had been inspired by the Islamic State. The suspect, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, was arrested in March. He had been seen in a video released by the Islamic State showing him holding a gun and speaking with a man in a white shirt and black pants. “We are going to take revenge for our brothers and sisters in Paris,” Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel said in the video. The video was released after the Paris attacks on Friday, when French officials said they believed that the assailant had been inspired by the Islamic State. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel is a Syrian citizen who grew up in Syria. He was born in Raqqa, the capital of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, and lived there until he was 15 years old, according to his family. He then moved to Damascus, where he attended high school and college. He was arrested in 2012 for assaulting a police officer in Damascus and sentenced to two years in prison. He was released in 2014, but returned to Syria in 2015, according to his family, and began working as a taxi driver. He also worked as a translator for the United Nations, according to his family. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel was married, and had two children, according to his relatives. His father died in 2013, and his mother had custody of him and his brother, according to the family. In the video released by the Islamic State, Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel said he wanted to kill people in France because he did not want them to be able to return to their country. “We will kill all of the infidels in France,” he said, according to the Islamic State. “We will kill all of the Christians, Muslims, Jews and any other infidel who tries to come to our lands.” The Paris attacks on Friday were the deadliest in the history of France, killing 129 people, including 129 civilians, and leaving more than 230 dead. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for those attacks. The Paris prosecutor, François Molins, said the Paris prosecutor’s office would investigate whether the Paris prosecutor’s office had jurisdiction over the case. The Paris prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in Brussels, and it has been linked to the other Paris attacks. A spokesman for the Belgian prosecutor’s office, Eric Van der Sypt, said it had opened an investigation into the Brussels attack. The Brussels prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, who had been seen in the video, has been identified as a Belgian national. It is unclear how he obtained the gun that he used in the attack. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Brussels attack before, and has called for its followers to carry out attacks in Europe. On Thursday, the group urged supporters to carry out attacks in Belgium, France and Germany. “We have a duty to carry out jihad in Europe and around the world,” the group said in a statement. “We call on all supporters of Islam to join us in jihad against enemies everywhere.” The Brussels attack is the third major attack in Europe in less than a year, and the first in Belgium since the Paris attacks. In February, a Tunisian man drove a van into crowds in Nice, France, killing 84 people. In March, a gunman attacked a concert hall in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people. And in May, a gunman opened fire in a bar in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people. None of the attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State or by the Islamic State-linked group known as ISIS. The Paris attacks were carried out by a radicalized man who had been living in Syria and had recently returned to France. In the days after the attacks, the authorities in France and Belgium hunted for the assailant, and they found him in a series of interviews and searches. The man, named only as Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, told investigators that he had been living in  Raqqa, the capital of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. He said he had been involved in fighting in Syria and had fought alongside the Islamic State, according to court documents. He said he had been  detained by the United States and its allies after his arrest. He said he was a member of the Islamic State’s “core leadership,” which is not defined in the documents. The documents were filed in federal court in New York on Wednesday. Mr. Al-Assad’s lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said that he had not seen the documents before they were filed. “We are still trying to piece together what happened to him,” he said. Mr. Al-Assad, who was born in Aleppo, the capital of Syria’s largest city, has spent most of his life in prisons. He was held at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, where he was interrogated for years as a detainee. In 2014, he was released and returned to Syria, where he joined the Islamic State, the group’s military wing. He was arrested again in 2016 and detained for more than a year, according to the Justice Department. In August, he was released and returned to Syria. The Justice Department has said it is seeking to extradite him from Syria to face trial in the United States. Mr. Al-Assad, who has never been charged with any crime, has been held since his return to Syria, and he has been interrogated by American officials. He has also been held at Guantánamo Bay, where he was held for more than a decade. He has never been charged with a crime. But Mr. Al-Assad’s case is unusual because he was captured in Syria, and he was there under the protection of the United States government. The Justice Department has said that Mr. Al-Assad was part of a cell that was plotting attacks against the United States and other countries, and that he was captured after an assault on a prison in Syria. The Justice Department has also said that Mr. Al-Assad was in contact with another terrorist organization, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, which is listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. The Justice Department has said that the Kurds are linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, also known as the P.K.K., and that Mr. Al-Assad was a leader of the group. The Justice Department has said that Mr. Al-Assad had been involved in planning attacks in the United States, including a plot to blow up a passenger jet in New York in 2010.

"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday of thwarting peace in the Middle East, speaking with a clarity and harshness almost never heard from American diplomats when discussing one of their closest and strongest allies. With only 23 days left in his four-year turn as secretary of state, during which he made the search for peace in the Middle East one of his driving missions, Mr. Kerry said the Israeli government was undermining any hope of a two-state solution to its decades-long conflict with the Palestinians. The American vote last week in the United Nations allowing the condemnation of Israel for settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, he added, was driven by a desire to save Israel from “the most extreme elements” in its own government. “The status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation,” Mr. Kerry said, his voice animated. His speech was a powerful admonition after years of tension and frustration, with the Obama administration giving public voice to its long-held concern that Israel was headed off a cliff toward international isolation and was condemning itself to a future of low-level, perpetual warfare with the Palestinians. Reaction was immediate and harsh, not only from Mr. Netanyahu, but also from Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. President-elect Donald J. Trump did not even wait for Mr. Kerry to speak before condemning the secretary of state. The United States and Israel are in the middle of a breach rarely seen since President Harry S. Truman recognized the fragile Israeli state in May 1948. In a direct response to Mr. Netanyahu’s barb over the weekend that “friends don’t take friends to the Security Council” — a reference to the Obama administration’s decision to abstain from the resolution condemning the building of new settlements in disputed territory — Mr. Kerry said the United States acted out of a deeper understanding of the meaning of its alliance. “Some seem to believe that the U.S. friendship means the U.S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles — even after urging again and again that the policy must change,” he said. “Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect.” Toward the end of his 70-minute speech in the State Department’s auditorium, Mr. Kerry acknowledged that Mr. Trump may well abandon the major principles that the United States has used for decades of Middle East negotiations, including the two-state solution that both Republicans and Democrats support. Mr. Trump is nominating a new American ambassador, David M. Friedman, who has broken with even the pretense of supporting a two-state negotiated agreement and has helped fund some of the settlements Mr. Kerry denounced. On vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump posted two Twitter messages rejecting the speech before it was delivered. “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,” he wrote on Wednesday morning. After assailing the nuclear deal in Iran and last week’s vote at the Security Council, he said, “Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!” He was soon praised — also on Twitter — by Mr. Netanyahu, who later released a video statement that was unsparingly direct and dismissive of Mr. Kerry. “The entire Middle East is going up in flames, entire countries are toppling, terrorism is raging and for an entire hour the secretary of state attacks the only democracy in the Middle East,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “Maybe Kerry did not notice that Israel is the only place in the Middle East where Christmas can be celebrated in peace and security. Sadly, none of this interests the secretary of state.” Mr. Kerry’s speech was criticized at home as well. Mr. McCain called it a “pointless tirade,” while Mr. Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, said he feared that Mr. Kerry had “emboldened extremists on both sides.” Mr. Kerry did make note of the Palestinian violence, the “extremist agenda” of Hamas, and the Palestinian unwillingness to recognize Israel. All, he said, were at the heart of the conflict. But Mr. Netanyahu’s continued support of settlements, “strategically placed in locations that make two states impossible,” he said, is driving a solution further and further away. Mr. Kerry argued that Israel, with a growing Arab population, could not survive as both a Jewish state and a democratic state unless it embraced the two-state approach that a succession of American presidents have endorsed. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, responded to Mr. Kerry’s speech by calling on Israel to freeze housing construction in order to restart negotiations. “The minute the Israeli government agrees to cease all settlement activities, including in and around occupied East Jerusalem, and agree to implement the signed agreements on the basis of mutual reciprocity, the Palestinian leadership stands ready to resume permanent status negotiations,” he said. Mr. Netanyahu has said he is willing to meet Mr. Abbas anytime for talks as long as there are no preconditions. It was notable that it was Mr. Kerry who delivered the speech rather than President Obama, who has long kept a distance from Middle East peace negotiations, a pursuit he has always doubted would succeed. After talks at Camp David collapsed in 2000, it was President Bill Clinton himself who gave a speech laying out the parameters of an ultimate deal, about 10 days before leaving office in 2001. At the time, Mr. Clinton also censured Israel for its settlements, but in far more measured terms. Mr. Kerry called them a violation of international law, a position he said the State Department had taken since 1978. “The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition is the most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements,” he said. “The result is that policies of this government — which the prime minister himself just described as ‘more committed to settlements than any in Israel’s history’ — are leading in the opposite direction, towards one state.” Seldom in modern American diplomacy has an American administration so directly confronted — and disavowed — a close ally’s actions as Mr. Kerry did on Wednesday, dropping most of the restraint he had shown in public over the past four years. One of the last times was during the Eisenhower administration, when the United States broke with Britain, France and Israel over the 1956 invasion of the Egyptian Sinai. Eisenhower had warned against the invasion and threatened to harm Britain’s financial system in retaliation. When Mr. Kerry got to the principles for a future settlement, they were unsurprising. Many date to the 1990s or earlier, and many to past United Nations resolutions. The principles he described started with a “secure and recognized border between Israel and a viable and contiguous Palestine,” based on Israel’s withdrawal from territory occupied since the 1967 war and land swaps to “reflect practical realities on the ground.” A second principle was the creation of a state for the Palestinian people, and a third was a “fair and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue,” including compensation. There was no mention of a “right of return” for refugees and their descendants forced to leave Israel and the Palestinian territories, back to 1948. The fourth principle called for Jerusalem to be the recognized capital of both states, which Mr. Kerry said was “the most sensitive issue for both sides.” The fifth was an agreement to satisfy Israel’s security needs while ending its military occupation of Palestinian territories. Mr. Kerry, who has cast himself as one of Israel’s greatest friends, said in recent months it became clear he had to “save the two-state solution while there was still time.” “We did not take this decision lightly,” he said of the vote in the United Nations Security Council, where the American abstention allowed a 14-to-0 condemnation of Israel go forward. “Israelis are fully justified in decrying attempts to delegitimize their state and question the right of a Jewish state to exist. But this vote was not about that. It was about actions that Israelis and Palestinians are taking that are increasingly rendering a two-state solution impossible.” It was also about Mr. Kerry’s own personal disappointment. As soon as he took over from Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in 2013, Mr. Kerry plunged into the tar pit of Middle East peace negotiations with an enthusiasm neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Obama shared. The goal was a nine-month negotiation leading to a “final status” of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by the summer of 2014. It never got that far. Despite scores of meetings between Mr. Kerry and his two main interlocutors, Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian president, and Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Kerry and his lead mediators, Martin S. Indyk and Frank Lowenstein, could not make progress. They blamed both sides for taking actions that undermined the process, but the continued expansion of the settlements was one of their leading complaints — an effort, in the American and European view, to establish “facts on the ground” so that territory could not be traded away. Mr. Netanyahu has accused the United States of “orchestrating” the vote, and his aides have said that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama effectively stabbed Israel in the back. Israeli officials have said they have evidence that the United States organized the resolution. Mr. Kerry pushed back at that narrative on Wednesday. Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, is biding his time and waiting for Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama to move on. Israeli leaders postponed plans on Wednesday to move ahead with new housing in East Jerusalem, just hours before the speech.","WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday of thwarting peace in the Middle East, speaking with a clarity and harshness almost never heard from American diplomats when discussing one of their closest and strongest allies.

But Mr. Kerry said that Mr. Obama had shown “no inclination whatsoever” to engage in serious negotiations with the Palestinians, even after they had won a Palestinian state in a United Nations vote in December. Instead, he said, he had “pushed for more settlements, more land, more settlements.” “We’ve seen the president’s policy,” Mr. Kerry said, “and it’s not working.” Mr. Kerry’s comments came just hours before he was scheduled to meet with Mr. Netanyahu and discuss ways to advance the talks. The Israeli leader, who is seeking re-election next week, has long criticized the Obama administration for what he calls its “unrealistic approach” toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he would not accept a two-state solution. A senior Israeli official said that Mr. Kerry would not be welcome at the White House if he tried to talk with Mr. Netanyahu about a two-state solution. “There will be no discussion with Mr. Netanyahu about two states,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the Israeli leader’s thinking. “He is not interested in talking about two states.” Mr. Netanyahu has said he would consider any peace deal that involved a Palestinian state, but he has not committed to one. The Israeli leader has said that he would prefer a two-state solution, but has not committed himself to one either. The Israeli official said that Mr. Netanyahu had not yet decided whether he would accept a two-state solution. “The prime minister has not made a decision,” he said. “But he is not interested in talking about two states.” Mr. Kerry’s comments came after Mr. Netanyahu met privately with President Obama on Tuesday evening, according to a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Yuval Steinitz. Mr. Netanyahu’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Kerry’s comments were the latest example of how the Obama administration has struggled to find common ground with Mr. Netanyahu, whose government has consistently rejected a two-state solution. Mr. Netanyahu’s government has repeatedly said that it would not accept a two-state solution, and that it would never accept a Palestinian state. The Obama administration has said it would consider such a solution if it could be reached, but has never offered one. In recent weeks, Mr. Obama has held up the prospect of reaching a two-state solution as a way to help secure a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.

Mr. Kerry’s comments on Wednesday came as the Obama administration faces increasing pressure from both Democrats and Republicans to move decisively toward a two-state solution.
