"URBANDALE, Iowa — One endured a childhood without running water, another spent his youth toiling over a McDonald’s grill and yet another is the son of a man who came to America with money sewn in his underwear. You would be forgiven if you mistook the initial introductions of the 2016 presidential candidates for latter-day, and somewhat clichéd, versions of a Horatio Alger story. The current White House hopefuls appear eager to outdo one another in recounting their up-from-poverty biographies, even if it means reaching back more than one generation. Candidates have sought to highlight their hardscrabble roots since the republic was young. Robert Strauss, the former Democratic chairman who died last year, once said every politician wants every voter to believe he was born in a log cabin he built himself. Yet as members of this group of presidential aspirants travel the circuit of banquets and forums, they seem intent on also claiming credit for chopping down the tree that supplied the logs. That is in large part because in addition to featuring the son of a cotton farmer, the son of a small-town minister and the granddaughter of a factory worker, the 2016 field includes the son and brother of a president whose grandfather was a senator. As Jeb Bush stockpiles money and attracts early support, largely because of his family name, his potential adversaries are seeking to differentiate themselves by all but stating explicitly that they are no senator’s grandson. “Unlike some out there, I didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family,” Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, told a group of religious broadcasters last month. Mr. Walker, whose father was a Baptist minister, may be the least subtle about it. But nearly all the candidates are introducing, or reintroducing, themselves to voters in ways that shine a light on Mr. Bush’s privileged origins. Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, was reared on a cotton farm in a house without running water. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, had the father who arrived in the United States with cash in his underwear, and Mr. Walker spent some of his teenage years laboring under the golden arches. “Listen, my dad put himself through college at night. He worked at an ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey, to put himself through college at night after he came back from the Army, and the next generation his son is the governor of the state of New Jersey,” Gov. Chris Christie said at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month. Not to be outdone, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told CPAC about his parents’ emigration from Cuba and the sacrifices they made for their children. “They had little money, no connections, quite frankly barely spoke the language and had a very limited education,” said Mr. Rubio. But the stories are not confined to the likely Republican field. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the all-but-announced Democratic candidate, used a speech last week to recount a family history that could have come from the pages of a Theodore Dreiser novel. “I’m like so many of you in this room and others whom I’ve met across this country,” Mrs. Clinton told Emily’s List, a Democratic women’s group. “My grandfather was a factory worker, started at the age of 11, worked until he was 65 and got to retire. His son, my father, went to college, was a small-business man who worked really hard and made a good life for us. My mother had a terrible, abusive childhood, had to leave at the age of 14 to go to work in order to support herself, having been abandoned by both her parents and her paternal grandparents.” If Mrs. Clinton would like to portray herself as far removed from the Goldman Sachs boardrooms and East Hampton beaches that some in her own party have tried to brand her with, Republicans feel even more urgency to connect to the electorate. For the Republicans, there is a tactical reason to contrast themselves with Mr. Bush, but the need to portray themselves as average Americans is even more fundamental. The last two Republican presidential nominees, each wealthy, lost in part because voters did not believe the candidates could relate to their struggles. Mitt Romney was savaged by Democrats for his tendency to affirm many rich-guy stereotypes, short of using “summer” as a verb. When Mr. Romney briefly considered a third presidential bid this year, Republicans pointed to what they saw as the most damning statistic from the 2012 exit polls: Among voters who said the candidate quality that most mattered to them was “cares about people like me,” President Obama won 81 percent to Mr. Romney’s 18 percent. “It has a lot to do with Romney and the disastrous campaign last time,” said Dave Carney, a Republican strategist, adding that Mr. Romney was for much of the 2012 campaign reluctant to show a more human side. The Everyman strategy is being employed this cycle in part because Republicans generally poll worse than Democrats on questions about who can better relate to voters, and because of the likely prospect of facing Mrs. Clinton in the general election. Mrs. Clinton has her own vulnerabilities, such as those $300,000 speeches and the fact that she has not driven a car for nearly a quarter-century. As the other potential Republican candidates sketch their only-in-America story, what is Mr. Bush left to say? John Kerry in 2004 leaned on his naval service in Vietnam and George W. Bush recalled his overcoming a fondness for beer, bourbon and B & B to connect to Americans with similar experiences. But Jeb Bush did not serve in the military and had no bouts with the bottle. What Mr. Bush does have, Mr. Carney noted, is a life story similar to that of his father, who had children young and left his parents’ East Coast preserve for a new life in the oil patch. “Forty-one went to West Texas in a Studebaker kicking up dust,” Mr. Carney said of the first President George Bush, for whom he worked. As Mr. Bush touched down here in suburban Des Moines on Friday for his first event in Iowa as a likely presidential candidate, hints of some forthcoming made-for-campaign biography could be heard. “I fell head over heels in love with this young, beautiful girl from León, Guanajuato, Mexico, and it kind of changed my life,” Mr. Bush said of meeting his wife when he was 17. He added: “My life can be divided between B.C. and A.C., Before Columba and After Columba.” Then, echoing his father, he explained how he had set out on his own. “We got married quickly, we had two kids, we lived in Venezuela, working for a bank,” he said. It had the all the makings of an eventual TV spot — at least until he got to the part about the bank.","URBANDALE, Iowa — One endured a childhood without running water, another spent his youth toiling over a McDonald’s grill and yet another is the son of a man who came to America with money sewn in his underwear.

You would be forgiven if you mistook the initial introductions of the 2016 presidential candidates for latter-day, and somewhat clichéd, versions of a Horatio Alger story.. But they are not. The first time Donald J. Trump spoke on stage at Liberty University last year was, as he put it, “like being back home.” He has since made similar comments about other parts of the country. And in an interview this week with The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Trump said that he had never seen anything like what happened when Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey invited him to speak at a Republican conference here. Mr. Christie, a former prosecutor, told reporters that he had been surprised by Mr. Trump’s request to come speak because he had not heard from him in months. “I didn’t know where he was,” Mr. Christie said. “He called me up and we talked for a while. I thought: Well, maybe he’s got something coming. We haven’t spoken for a long time.” In the years since then, Mr. Trump has become more outspoken than ever before in public life. On Thursday, he will host a rally in Cedar Rapids, which hosts one of the largest gatherings of evangelical Christians in the United States. At the same time, he has continued to make statements that have often been taken out of context or mischaracterized, including saying that Hillary Clinton was a “nasty woman” during a 2012 campaign stop in South Carolina. When asked about that remark at a news conference earlier this month, Mr. Trump said he meant no disrespect. “That’s not what I said,” he said. “I said she wasn’t very nice, but I don’t want to go into the details.” But after reviewing hundreds of interviews with people close to Mr. Trump, many of whom were interviewed under oath, I found that there is little doubt that he is still struggling to find his footing. His most recent remarks suggest that he is still trying to gain traction. For example, he recently said that he did not believe President Obama was born outside the United States. Now, he says, he does. But he also says things that seem to contradict himself, such as describing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas as having “a great smile” and suggesting that Mrs. Clinton should have won the popular vote. What is clear is that he still needs to find his way. It seems likely that he will continue to struggle until he finds some semblance of clarity, though whether that comes in the form of a speech delivered by someone else remains to be seen. He has said in the past that he likes to listen to music, and he has played several records recently, including Bob Marley’s 1978 song “We Will Rock You.” But he has also said he listens to rap music, particularly Eminem’s “The Slim Shady LP” (which features lyrics about sex). He has said he once read books by authors whose names start with A, B, C, D or E. He has even said he likes reading poetry. Yet he has also said he does not read enough, and that he does not know how to play piano. So far, he has said that he is “not very good at golf,” although he has shown that he can hit a ball into a hole. He has also said he likes playing cards, and has shown that he can play cribbage. He has said he has trouble walking, and has shown that he can walk well enough to get through a grocery store line. He has said he likes watching TV, and has shown that he can watch television well enough to understand what is going on. He has said he has difficulty making decisions, and has shown that he understands how to make them. He has said he wants to travel, and has shown that he can travel well enough to take a bus. He has said he likes movies, and has shown that he can enjoy them. He has said he enjoys sports, and has shown that he can enjoy them. And he has said he likes to listen to music, and has shown that he can listen to music well enough to understand what is going on. Yet he has also said he cannot drive a car, and has said he cannot ride a horse. He has said he has trouble with math, and has shown that he can do basic math. He has said he cannot write, and has shown that he can write well enough to write a newspaper article. He has said he does not understand why others think he is stupid, and has shown that he can understand what others mean by that. He has said he does not have a sense of humor, and has shown that he can be funny. He has said he has trouble sleeping, and has shown that he can sleep better if he tries. He has said he likes to eat ice cream, and has shown that he can eat ice cream well enough for it to be good. And most important of all: he has said that his favorite color is blue. That’s about the extent of his personality on this issue, but there are many more examples. In fact, when asked in an interview last year whether Mr. Trump was “a racist,” Mr. Trump replied, “I don’t know what you call people who hate other races. I am not a racist.” What Mr. Trump means by “racist” is unclear, though the term is often used as a pejorative insult. But in interviews with The New York Times, Mr. Trump has made clear that he thinks race relations are at their worst since slavery. He says blacks should not vote because they are too violent or because they do not want black men to succeed. He also believes that African-Americans should not vote because they have so much power in society. “If you look at African-American history,” he told NBC News recently, “you will see that they were never really given any real opportunities. They had very little opportunity, and now we have taken advantage of them.” But even some of those remarks seem like a stretch. Mr. Trump has said he would not say that whites have too much power, nor that blacks have too much power. So how could he have been referring to blacks? Or Hispanics? Or Asians? He might have meant all three groups. His comments may also be a way of saying he has no idea what the proper terminology is for describing black people. It is true that he has said he doesn’t believe blacks are all bad and whites are all good. But he has also said, “I have a lot of problems with certain kinds of people,” including Mexicans, Muslims, Jews, Haitians, Africans and Japanese Americans. Mr. Trump did not use the word “racist” in an interview last year with CNN. In an email interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, he said, “It’s one of those words I just don’t know how to explain.” He added, “I am not a racist.” Some Republicans argue that Mr. Trump is simply using the phrase “the N word,” which he has called out as problematic. But critics say that he is also making racially charged statements — sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. For example, Mr. Trump has suggested that white women are less likely than black women to get abortions. Black women make up only 2 percent of the population, according to census data. Yet he has called black women “dog lovers” and “crazed animals.” On another occasion, he said, “The reason why blacks are so angry is they have such low self-esteem.” He has also said that blacks are “so dumb” and “have such big heads.” Those comments were part of a series of inflammatory posts Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana. But Mr. Trump has also used racial slurs himself. In 2005, he tweeted that George W. Bush was a “fascist.” When President Obama visited South Carolina last summer, Mr. Trump said he wanted him to take back the state from Gov. Nikki Haley, whom he had appointed as ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Haley later apologized, but she still faced criticism from conservatives, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who accused her of trying to undermine the president’s policies. Mr. Trump has also said that Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be secretary of state. He has said that Barack Obama is not a legitimate president. He has questioned the legitimacy of the election results in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. He has referred to Haiti as “shithole country” and Mexico as “rapists” and “killers.” He has said he cannot wait until a Democrat becomes president. Mr. Trump has said he does not care who wins the White House, as long as he gets his wall built. In recent weeks, he has said that he wants to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, as well as a barrier along the Mexican border. He has also said that he does not mind paying for it. Mr. Trump has said that he does not pay taxes, and that his companies pay taxes."
"CLEVELAND — Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her campaign on Friday, working to ensure a victory that is decisive enough to earn a mandate for her presidency and a surge of voters to help Democrats win congressional races. Emerging from a nine-day absence from the trail, Mrs. Clinton seized on the momentum of her performance in the final presidential debate, choosing Ohio — a battleground state where she has struggled the most against Donald J. Trump — as her first stop on a four-day swing. With new polls showing Mrs. Clinton closing in on Mr. Trump in the state, her campaign is glimpsing the opportunity for a clean sweep of traditional swing states. Reminding voters of Mr. Trump’s refusal in Wednesday’s debate to say definitively he would accept the outcome on Election Day, Mrs. Clinton said that as secretary of state she had visited countries whose leaders jailed political opponents and invalidated elections they did not win. “We know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship,” she said. She also portrayed herself as a candidate who could attract independent, undecided and even Republican voters unhappy with Mr. Trump’s campaign. “I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support of my opponent,” she said. “I know you still may have questions for me, I respect that. I want to answer them. I want to earn your vote.” Her stop here marked the start of a rare multiday tour of swing states as the Clinton campaign revved up its efforts to decisively defeat Mr. Trump on Nov. 8, including releasing a powerful minute-long ad featuring Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. The ad featuring Mr. Khan, who was attacked by Mr. Trump after he spoke at the Democratic convention, will run in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as other crucial states. With Mrs. Clinton holding a healthy lead in most national polls, Democrats have turned their focus to trying to ensure victory by as large a margin as possible, deploying Michelle Obama in Arizona and President Obama in Florida. The larger the victory, the less Mr. Trump and his supporters can claim foul play, Mrs. Clinton’s allies said. A month ago, Ohio seemed to be aligning as a Trump stronghold, as its large bloc of white working-class voters responded to Mr. Trump’s economic populism and America-first message. But the state is now back in play, with a poll from Suffolk University in Boston showing a tied race. Mrs. Clinton’s afternoon rally at a community college in Cleveland, the heart of Democratic strength in Ohio, was aimed at increasing early voting, which began last week. While early voting has traditionally been a Democratic strength in Ohio, the data shows potential complications for Mrs. Clinton on this front. Requests for early ballots are down 22.3 percent in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is, compared with the same period in 2012. Requests are also off 12.7 percent in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital, according to data compiled by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies voter turnout. A decided advantage for Mrs. Clinton here is the strength of Democrats’ grass-roots efforts. The party has leased 93 offices statewide, according to Chris Wyant, the Clinton campaign director in Ohio. Mr. Trump’s Ohio director cut ties recently with the state’s Republican chairman, Matt Borges, over Mr. Borges’s sharply worded public doubts about Mr. Trump. “They have an internal civil war on the Republican side,” Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, told reporters here. He added that two weeks ago, Mr. Trump was slightly ahead in the state. “But Ohio is really a symbol of the progress we’ve made in the past two weeks since the first debate,” he said. Ohio is not essential to Mrs. Clinton’s road to the White House. She could lose it and still romp through the Electoral College given her dominance in other swing states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado, according to polls. Mr. Trump spent the day hopscotching to rallies in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, a state where Mrs. Clinton has built a formidable lead. While he projected a subdued confidence at a rally in Fletcher, N.C., he also seemed to prepare for at least the possibility of an Election Day loss. “I don’t know what kind of shape I’m in, but I’ll be happy, and at least I will have known, win, lose or draw — and I’m almost sure, if the people come out, we’re going to win — I will be happy with myself,” he said. At his rally in Fletcher, he offered a slightly more restrained version of his typically freewheeling speech, largely hewing to his prepared remarks. Gone were his complaints of a “rigged” and “stolen” election — they have drawn condemnation by Democrats and Republicans alike — and he did not, as he has recently, try to counter accusations from the 10 women who have come forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual advances. The Trump campaign has said that it plans to increase Mr. Trump’s schedule in the final weeks, potentially holding as many as six rallies a day. Mr. Trump explained that he wanted to have no regrets, should he lose. “I don’t want to think back, ‘If only I did one more rally, I would have won North Carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes.’” Later, again seeming to acknowledge that he might not win the White House, he grumbled, “What a waste of time if we don’t pull this off.” Mr. Trump’s team increasingly views North Carolina as a state that is critical to a victory in November, along with others like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, visited the same town just last week. At a rally later on Friday in Johnstown, Pa., Mr. Trump took the stage with a renewed vigor — “I just got caught in the rain,” he bellowed, “how does my hair look?” — and he returned to his theme of a “rigged system.” Speaking to a crowd in the mill town, Mr. Trump cast himself as the champion of Pennsylvania’s working class. “The iron and steels forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation,” he said, promising to bring prosperity back to the region. “You were the leading steel producer in the United States — did you know that?” In Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of buying Chinese-made steel for his high-rise buildings. “I’m going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steelworker filing for unemployment,” she said. Seemingly energized by the more raucous Pennsylvania crowd, Mr. Trump ended his rally with a call to victory. “We will win,” he said. “We will shock the world.” Then, Mr. Trump, who, on the eve of a campaign trip to Scotland, admitted he did not really understand the nuances of the “Brexit” vote, ended with an ebullient rallying cry by predicting an upset victory. His win in November, he said, would be “Brexit-plus.” But a full day of events seemed to drain some of the energy from Mr. Trump, whose mood often rises on the strength of his crowds. At his final rally of the day, in Newtown, Pa., the Republican nominee began well ahead of schedule, spoke for just 30 minutes and wrapped up his speech at 7:31 p.m. — exactly one minute after he was originally slated to take the stage.","CLEVELAND — Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her campaign on Friday, working to ensure a victory that is decisive enough to earn a mandate for her presidency and a surge of voters to help Democrats win congressional races.

The last time Mrs. Clinton had campaigned in such large numbers was during the 2008 Democratic primaries when she visited all 50 states and won more than 100 delegates. But the new focus on the general election is just one facet of the race that will be played out over the next week or so. With polls showing Mr. Trump leading by double digits in many states, Mrs. Clinton faces a steep climb ahead of Tuesday’s contests in South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida. Her path to victory runs through a string of early voting states like Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico that are likely to vote later this month. And it includes two key tests: She must defend her home turf convincingly in Iowa, which holds its primary on Feb. 1; and then defeat Senator Bernie Sanders in South Dakota, which votes March 15. On Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton held a fund-raiser in Brooklyn, N.Y., highlighting her efforts to turn around what appears to be slipping away from her. It was her second visit to the borough since returning from her trip to California to promote her book about her life in the White House. In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has made stops in Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. After spending much of the day campaigning in Westchester County, N.Y., the Clintons took their car into Manhattan, stopping at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they were photographed standing among works by Picasso, Kandinsky, Mondrian, Rothko and others. They also stopped at the Metropolitan Opera house, where Mrs. Clinton posed for pictures with some of her husband’s favorite operas, including La Bohème and Don Giovanni. Later in the evening, the couple went to dinner with friends who included Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. “I am going to keep fighting until I can no longer do anything else,” said Ms. Clinton, adding that she would not rest until she could take back control of the country. “I am determined to change the direction of our country and make sure that every child gets an opportunity to succeed in school and in life,” she said. “It is my hope that we can get back to work together again, because there is still plenty of work to be done.” As Mrs. Clinton spoke, a sea of people stood in front of a portrait of President Abraham Lincoln that hung on the wall of the grandstand. A few feet behind the president’s image, another portrait of Abraham Lincoln stared down from a nearby ledge. In a sign of how far the Clintons have come, the crowd roared when Mr. Obama appeared onstage and delivered his acceptance speech at the University of Colorado Boulder. He called the United States “a shining city upon a hill.” And he urged Americans to embrace optimism. “The future belongs to those who believe in the power of dreams,” he said. “Dreams that matter, that inspire, that challenge us to reach higher. That bind us together.” The Clintons arrived at the University of Colorado at 10 p.m. after flying from San Francisco to Denver, arriving in time to watch the commencement ceremony. At 11:30, Mrs. Clinton arrived to give remarks to the graduating seniors. She spent a half hour speaking about her upbringing in rural Vermont and how she became interested in public service. When asked by reporters afterward if she thought the audience would be receptive to the message, Mrs. Clinton replied simply, “Yes.” She also addressed the graduates, saying, “It is my great honor to introduce you to your fellow classmates. You are part of a special family. We are proud of you and look forward to seeing you graduate soon.” For days, Mrs. Clinton has been focused on preparing for a difficult fight on Super Tuesday, the crucial round of primaries that take place on April 26 in South Carolina and North Carolina. Those contests are critical to ensuring that Republicans hold onto the Senate majority and maintain control of the chamber. While her team has been counting on Mr. Trump’s unpopularity in both states, Mrs. Clinton has been taking steps to try to prevent him from making gains. The campaign is being run by Stephen K. Bannon, the chief executive of Breitbart News Network, a website that promotes white nationalist ideas. His top strategist, David Bossie, is helping oversee the operation. The site has promoted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton as well as anti-Semitic rants against Israel. In an interview published Sunday morning on Fox News, Mr. Bossie said that Mrs. Clinton’s advisers had been aware of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for months and were not surprised to see him emerge in the presidential race. “They knew he was going to be there for a while, but they didn’t know it would take off so quickly,” Mr. Bossie said. “I think she had some reservations because she thought this was a little bit too early for her to have any involvement with this particular candidate. But I don’t think anyone was surprised by his rise.” The network has also pushed back hard against claims by critics that its writers are biased or paid for their work. On Friday evening, after Mr. Trump made comments suggesting that Senator John McCain of Arizona should not have received praise during the funeral service for his late son, President Obama called the criticism “hogwash” and suggested that the Clintons might want to rethink their relationship with Mr. McCain. A spokesman for the former president, Nick Ayers, denied that Mr. McCain was paid for his services by the news media. He also pointed out that Mr. McCain did not endorse Mr. Trump at the time the Republican nominee was campaigning against Hillary Clinton in South Carolina. “Senator McCain did not endorse Donald J. Trump until days before the election,” the spokesman, Matt Gorman, said in a statement. “The Clintons did not receive any money from Mr. Trump when he ran ads attacking Mrs. Clinton.” The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, who was in Washington last week to meet with reporters, said Monday that Mr. Trump had no role in the decision to end the long-running feud between the Clintons and Barack Obama over Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. “We had nothing to do with it,” Mr. Spicer told reporters at the State Department briefing room in New York City. “It was something that was brought up internally,” he added. “I can’t tell you what happened in terms of how we handled it, but I can tell you that the president has no idea why it ended up there.” The Clintons have long maintained that they never asked Mr. Obama to stop using Mrs. Clinton’s personal emails and that they did not authorize them. They have also insisted that they did not send messages to Ms. Abedin, the deputy chief of staff, asking her to delete a message sent to her husband, Anthony D. Weiner, a Democratic Representative from New Jersey, which included lewd remarks about women. Mr. Obama has repeatedly denied sending such messages. “If anybody knows anything about politics, it is that nobody has more respect for the Clintons than I do,” Mr. Obama said last month, adding that he had met privately with Mrs. Clinton several times since taking office in 2009. “She’s my friend,” he added. “I’ve known her all my life. She’s a very special person.” Mrs. Clinton has long said she did not ask Mr. Obama to change his behavior. When pressed by CNN’s Jim Clancy on whether she had ever spoken directly to Mr. Obama about the issue, she replied: “No, I haven’t.” The Clintons’ relationship with Mr. Obama dates to the 1990s, when both served as United States attorneys. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama was a surrogate for Bill Clinton’s re-election bid. And, according to people familiar with the matter, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama spoke often about Mr. Trump’s candidacy. After Mr. Trump won the nomination, Mrs. Clinton, who had already begun to distance herself from Mr. Obama, began to call him “Mr. Nice Guy” and even to refer to him as “that guy.” “I’m sure that they talked about it,” said Scott W. Reed, a longtime political consultant who worked on behalf of the Clintons for years. “But I don’t know if it’s a good thing.” In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has made public statements criticizing Mr. Trump’s temperament and questioned his business acumen. In one instance, she said that Mr. Trump’s personality could make him vulnerable to attacks like those that plagued George Bush."
"WASHINGTON — As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments on Wednesday on whether to invalidate a crucial part of the president’s health care law, Obama administration officials say they are doing nothing to prepare for what could be a catastrophic defeat. Administration officials insist that any steps they could take to prepare for the potential crisis would be politically unworkable and ineffective, and that pursuing them would wrongly signal to the justices that reasonable solutions existed. The do-nothing strategy is meant to reinforce for the court what White House officials believe: that a loss in the health care case would be unavoidably disastrous for millions of people. There are no contingency plans in place if the court invalidates the Affordable Care Act subsidies that 7.5 million people in 34 states are receiving, administration officials said. No one is strategizing with governors or insurance company executives or lawmakers. There is no public relations plan to reassure people who might suddenly have to pay more for insurance. If the court rejects the subsidies — a decision unlikely to arrive until the end of the session in late June or early July — health experts said premiums could triple within weeks, causing millions of people to lose coverage. That could quickly lead to a collapse of the health insurance markets in two-thirds of the country. “If they rule against us, we’ll have to take a look at what our options are. But I’m not going to anticipate that,” President Obama said Monday in an interview with Reuters. “I’m not going to anticipate bad law.” The strategy echoes the administration’s refusal through most of 2012 to acknowledge any planning for the effect of across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration, insisting that the draconian cuts would never come to pass. (They did.) Also in 2012, the White House and its allies said there were no plans for the Supreme Court ruling on a challenge to the health law’s individual mandate. (The court upheld the mandate.) In the current health care case, legal experts said the White House was savvy in making clear that the situation was dire. They said the justices regularly considered the broader effect of their decisions and often took into account how the executive branch or Congress might respond to a ruling. Jeffrey L. Fisher, a law professor at Stanford University, said the justices are likely to talk about the administration’s lack of contingency plans when they meet behind closed doors on Friday for their first conference after hearing arguments. ”They are going to think about whether they buy it, whether they think it’s strategy,” Mr. Fisher said. “It’s something that a court would traditionally at least put into the melting pot of consideration.” The latest legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act was brought by opponents who say Congress authorized subsidies to be issued  only to people who signed up for coverage in one of 17 state-run marketplaces, not those who enrolled through the federal HealthCare.gov website. Government lawyers say lawmakers intended the subsidies to be available everywhere. Mr. Obama’s advisers continue to say they are confident the law will survive the court challenge. But if it does not, within weeks of the ruling the government will have to stop sending tax credits to insurance companies on behalf of the millions who signed up through HealthCare.gov and were promised hefty subsidies to offset the cost of premiums. Most of those people would no longer be required by the law’s individual mandate to have insurance, because part of the law provides exemptions when affordable insurance is not available. As a result, all but the sickest would choose to cancel their insurance, experts predicted. With healthy people no longer choosing to be covered, experts said, most insurance companies would pull out of the markets in those states rather than cover only the sickest — and most expensive — customers. The result would be a “death spiral,” according to the Supreme Court brief filed by America’s Health Insurance Plans, the nation’s health insurance trade group. “It would leave consumers in those states with a more unstable market and far higher costs,” the group argued in the brief. Soon after the ruling, health care experts said, the White House could work with lawmakers to pass new legislation clarifying that the subsidies should be available everywhere. But that would require the unlikely support of Republicans who have fiercely opposed the president’s law and sought to repeal it. “It would take a wrecking ball to a major part of the Affordable Care Act,” Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said of a loss in the court. “It’s hard to see how it would be fixed, absent legislation. And Republicans have made it clear they have no interest in fixing it.” Experts said the administration could encourage more states to set up their own insurance marketplaces, which are permitted to provide subsidies. Health experts said the administration could also provide waivers, financial assistance or technical expertise to help the states, although the process could take years to complete. States with a Republican governor or legislature are likely to refuse. The federal government could also approve the formation of regional insurance marketplaces, but political leaders in the states would have to agree to participate. “There aren’t any magic solutions here,” said Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. If the court throws out the subsidies, experts say, it is unclear whether Mr. Obama, the court or Republicans will be blamed for the confusion. “A court decision would unleash a giant game of political chicken,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that does research on health care. “How that ends up would depend a lot on who is getting the blame for the chaos that would ensue.” The situation has already enraged the administration’s Republican critics, who hope the court will do what they have been unable to accomplish in Congress: unravel the president’s chief domestic accomplishment. “By admitting they have no contingency plan to assist the millions that may lose subsidies, the administration confirms how the misguided law is unworkable for the American people,” Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said last week. Mr. Hatch is part of a Republican group that is working on proposals to help stabilize the insurance markets in the aftermath of a ruling against the government. He said the goal of the group’s efforts was to eventually repeal and replace the president’s health care law. “We would provide financial assistance to help Americans keep the coverage they picked for a transitional period,” Mr. Hatch and two other senators wrote in a letter in The Washington Post this week. In the House, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and several other lawmakers are proposing legislation to allow states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and to provide tax credits to buy health insurance that could help people who might lose their subsidies. The Republican lawmakers have not offered details of their proposals, but Mr. Obama’s allies said they expected the Republicans to do little to ease the crisis if people could no longer receive subsidies. “They should not be under any illusions that you can easily pick up the pieces,” Mr. Van Hollen said of the nine justices. He said the Supreme Court should keep that in mind as it heard the case. “If they render a decision that blows a hole in the law,” Mr. Van Hollen said, “there is no tidy fix to this.”","WASHINGTON — As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments on Wednesday on whether to invalidate a crucial part of the president’s health care law, Obama administration officials say they are doing nothing to prepare for what could be a catastrophic defeat. Administration officials insist that any steps they could take to prepare for the potential crisis would be politically unworkable and ineffective, and that pursuing them would wrongly signal to the justices that reasonable solutions existed.","WASHINGTON — As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments on Wednesday on whether to invalidate a crucial part of the president’s health care law, Obama administration officials say they are doing nothing to prepare for what could be a catastrophic defeat. Administration officials insist that any steps they could take to prepare for the potential crisis would be politically unworkable and ineffective, and that pursuing them would wrongly signal to the justices that reasonable solutions existed.. But in interviews with The New York Times, several former government officials said they were concerned about how President Trump might respond if he learned that his signature domestic achievement was being challenged by the court. “The fact is that we don’t have much time left at this point,” one senior official said. “If you think it can go down as quickly as it has gone up, I think people will panic.” A lawyer for Mr. Trump has called the legal challenge against the Affordable Care Act an attempt to undermine the constitutionality of the act, but the challengers themselves have not explained why their effort should succeed. And while some Democrats have argued that Republicans should work more closely with states before enacting major changes to health care legislation, there is little evidence that such collaboration would help. One Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said that the White House had been considering options to avoid a federal judge striking down parts of the law, including using executive orders or issuing guidance documents to state insurance regulators. Another official said that the Justice Department had considered how to deal with the possibility that the court would strike down the entire law. Still another official said the department was preparing contingency plans to protect people from losing coverage under the law. In addition, many of those planning to vote next week against the measure have expressed reservations about its benefits, which include lowering premiums for millions of low-income Americans, allowing young adults to stay on track into adulthood without having to pay out of pocket costs, and reducing deductibles. Some critics of the bill also worry that it does not do enough to address the needs of older Americans, whose medical bills often exceed the amount of money they receive through Medicare. “It’s going to be very hard to sell everyone on something that doesn’t have a lot of specifics,” said David Cutler, a law professor at Columbia University and a longtime opponent of Obamacare. “I’m worried about trying to convince people that it’s good because it’s better than what they’re getting now.” Mr. Trump has vowed to keep fighting until Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act, and he has repeatedly threatened to veto any congressional efforts to repeal the health law. He has made clear that he intends to use the threat of a lawsuit challenging the law to block Republican attempts to dismantle it. On Monday, the Senate voted 52 to 47 to approve a bipartisan measure that would allow states to opt out of certain aspects of the health law. That measure passed the House last month. If Mr. Trump loses, the consequences could be far graver: His presidency could collapse, leaving him unable to run again for office; the courts could rule that he cannot legally block new laws enacted by Congress; or even the country itself may face economic catastrophe. Mr. Trump has shown no inclination to make peace with the decision. In recent days, he has suggested that he would consider a pardon for himself, a suggestion that has raised fears among conservatives who believe that the president would never accept responsibility for his actions. Last weekend, he told Fox News viewers that he did not want to be pardoned. “I’ve got my own lawyers, and I’ll probably be talking to them,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m not looking forward to the other side coming after me for pardoning myself.” Mr. Trump also appeared to suggest on Twitter on Sunday night that he would like to see his tax records released so that he could claim that he paid all his taxes. At least three current and former members of the Trump campaign said the president did not intend to honor his pledge to release his returns. Mr. Trump has insisted publicly that he has never broken his promise to release his returns. Mr. Trump’s advisers have said privately that the president will eventually release his returns, though he has resisted calls for him to do so. After winning election, Mr. Trump promised to reveal his returns when he was asked. But he has resisted requests from reporters and others to disclose his returns. He has refused to answer questions about his finances from reporters who have written stories questioning his claims of income and expenses. And he has declined to answer questions from lawmakers who have pressed him over the issue. On Saturday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said that Mr. Trump would release his returns “in due course.” But the returns are likely to remain private indefinitely.. Mr. Trump has denied reports that he has received threats from Russian intelligence officers, saying that he has never met with anyone linked to Russia. He has also denied accusations of financial improprieties involving foreign governments. He has said that he is not required to report large amounts of income earned overseas. Mr. Trump’s business empire includes real estate deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars. As president, he owns stakes in two hotels and a golf course. His personal assets include the Miss Universe pageant, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and a condominium complex in New York City. The New Yorker magazine reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had been warned by federal investigators about possible conflicts of interest related to his business interests. In an interview broadcast on CNN last week, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, defended Mr. Trump against questions over whether he was being investigated for potential crimes. “I think it’s fair to say that we have no idea what the investigation is looking into at this point, but I would certainly be surprised if there were any criminal charges or anything like that,” Mr. Spicer said. On Thursday evening, the president said that he did not know why CNN had chosen to run the story, adding: “It’s probably because they want ratings. They don’t care who gets hurt.” But the president’s remarks seemed to suggest that the investigation may involve more than just one company. And Mr. Trump’s refusal to answer questions about his finances — which are routinely scrutinized by congressional committees — suggested that he might face additional scrutiny as well. A spokesman for Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the committee had been contacted by Mr. Trump’s lawyers about the matter. He declined to elaborate. Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said on Twitter that the president was “not under investigation” for any wrongdoing. Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week. The president’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is expected to testify publicly on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is scheduled to appear before the same committee on Monday. If Mr. Trump is questioned about his business dealings, he could invoke executive privilege, which allows him to refuse to answer questions. It is unclear how much information Mr. Trump will be able to withhold from Congress. The Justice Department has asked for documents from companies connected to Mr. Trump. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said on Friday that he wanted to hear directly from the president, rather than through a third party. “If you’re going to take shots at Donald J. Trump, you need to take them directly,” he said. “You can’t go around shooting people in other countries. You have to take them personally.” Mr. Trump’s comments came hours after several news organizations reported that the F.B.I. raided a Manhattan office of Fusion GPS, the research firm that compiled the so-called Steele dossier. The New York Times and BuzzFeed News reported that agents seized records relating to the dossier, including emails between journalists and Christopher Steele, a British citizen who claimed to be working for the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The Times and BuzzFeed News cited unnamed sources familiar with the case. At least three members of the bureau have since confirmed their involvement. Fusion GPS, founded by Glenn R. Simpson, a retired military intelligence officer, hired opposition researcher Peter Schweizer to conduct research on behalf of Democrats seeking to discredit Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Steele’s work was funded by the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the dossier a “witch hunt” and has repeatedly denied having anything to do with it. The president has questioned the value of the dossier, saying that he had read only snippets of its contents. When pressed on Friday, he refused to discuss specifics. “I am not going to talk about my tax returns,” he said. “That’s none of your business.” He added: “You can ask me all sorts of things. What does the State Department have to do with it? That’s none of your business.” Mr. Trump’s lawyers have argued that he cannot be compelled to answer questions about his business dealings without risking damaging his presidency. While the president has repeatedly insisted that he has nothing to hide, the president’s lawyers have said that the Constitution bars presidents from being forced to reveal their taxes."
"WASHINGTON — After weeks of uncertainty atop the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Trump dismissed its secretary, David J. Shulkin, on Wednesday and announced he would replace him with the White House physician, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. If confirmed, Dr. Jackson, a career Naval officer who has no real experience running a large bureaucracy, would inherit a set of challenges that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican administrations alike. The department, the federal government’s second largest, has been burdened for years by aging infrastructure, an inefficient health care system and an unwieldy 360,000-person work force. He could also quickly face crucial, multibillion-dollar decisions over the replacement of its outdated computerized records system and legislation that would ease the rules around veterans seeking private health care at government expense. The announcement punctuated what has been a rapid fall from favor for Dr. Shulkin, a politically moderate former hospital executive who delivered Mr. Trump a string of bipartisan legislative victories at a time when he was struggling to find them. But in his final weeks, he struggled to fight off attempts by more conservative administration officials to have him removed and was dogged by an unflattering inspector general report on his overseas travel that undermined his relationship with the president. Dr. Shulkin’s departure was the latest chapter in the remaking of Mr. Trump’s team of senior advisers, a shake-up that has led to the replacement of the secretary of state, the director of the C.I.A. and the national security adviser, along with White House aides. In the midst of that turmoil, Dr. Jackson, 50, who was named to his current position by President Barack Obama in 2013, has grown close with Mr. Trump, a commander in chief who enjoys familiar faces in his orbit and often rewards them with new roles. Dr. Jackson had a rare turn in the spotlight in January, when he announced the results of Mr. Trump’s physical, his first while in office, and addressed speculation over the president’s physical and mental health. The president was very pleased with the performance. “I’ve found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” Dr. Jackson said. His policy views are all but unknown, though, especially on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will decide whether he is up to leading the department. Senators, including Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, issued cautious statements on Wednesday praising Dr. Shulkin and indicating that they would need to get to know the nominee. That tone was echoed by mainstream veterans groups like Disabled American Veterans and the American Legion, who hold considerable sway in Washington, and who warned of a potential leadership vacuum at the department. Privately, several White House aides acknowledged that Dr. Jackson’s lack of managerial experience could be problematic and said that once again the president’s interest in his personal bond with someone was more significant than their curriculum vitae. In a Twitter post on Wednesday announcing the changes, Mr. Trump called Dr. Jackson “highly respected” and thanked Dr. Shulkin for “service to our country and to our great veterans.” Mr. Trump said that Robert Wilkie, the under secretary for defense personnel and readiness at the Defense Department, would serve as acting secretary in the meantime, bypassing the department’s deputy secretary, Thomas G. Bowman. The White House did not respond to a request asking who would replace Dr. Jackson. Dr. Shulkin, who served as under secretary of veterans affairs in the Obama administration, had begun to make headway on some of the department’s most persistent problems. Those included an expansion of the G.I. Bill for post-9/11 veterans, legislation that makes it easier for the department to remove bad employees and a law that streamlines the appeals process for veterans seeking disability benefits. Those successes and his easy grasp of complicated policy issues won Dr. Shulkin deep support on Capitol Hill and among veterans groups. And Mr. Trump, who made veterans issues and overhauling the scandal-ridden department a focal point of his campaign, showered Dr. Shulkin with praise. At a bill-signing ceremony in June, the president teased that the secretary need never worry about hearing his “Apprentice”-era catchphrase, “You’re fired.” “We’ll never have to use those words on our David,” Mr. Trump said. “We will never use those words on you, that’s for sure.” But in recent months, a group of conservative Trump administration appointees at the White House and the department began to break with the secretary and plot his ouster. At issue was how far and how fast to privatize health care for veterans, a long-sought goal for conservatives like the Koch brothers. The officials — who included Dr. Shulkin’s press secretary and assistant secretary for communications, along with a top White House domestic policy aide — came to consider Dr. Shulkin and his top deputy as obstacles. The secretary’s troubles only grew when what had been an internal power struggle burst into the open in February, after the department’s inspector general issued a scathing report on a trip Dr. Shulkin took last year to Britain and Denmark. The report, describing what it called “serious derelictions,” found the secretary had spent much of the trip sightseeing and had improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift. Critics of the secretary seized on the report to try to hasten his removal. Dr. Shulkin, fearing a coup, went public with a warning about officials “trying to undermine the department from within” and cut off those he saw as disloyal. The efforts backfired. At the White House, senior officials came to believe that Dr. Shulkin had misled them about the contents of the report. And the secretary’s public declarations only further aggravated top officials, who felt Dr. Shulkin had gone too far in commenting on internal politics with news outlets and had opened the administration to sharp criticism over his trip to Europe, which the report said cost more than $122,000. But as recently as early March, after meetings with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Dr. Shulkin publicly claimed victory, signaling that he had the White House’s support to remove officials opposing him. The victory was short-lived. Before long, Dr. Shulkin sharply curtailed his public profile, cutting off communications with reporters and isolating himself from top deputies he viewed as disloyal. People who have spoken with the secretary in recent days said he was determined to keep his post, even as it became increasingly clear his time was up. He was set to meet with leaders from the nation’s largest veterans groups on Thursday. Despite his problems with the White House, Dr. Shulkin remained overwhelmingly popular on Capitol Hill, where the Senate unanimously confirmed him last year, and among the veterans groups that have traditionally held outsize influence in Washington. In recent weeks, leaders from both parties publicly and privately signaled their support, even as rumors of his replacement appeared in news reports. But Mr. Trump had had enough. He began to discuss successors in recent weeks, even considering  Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a possibility. He told friends last weekend that he would fire Dr. Shulkin, it was just a question of when. Dr. Shulkin had made a preliminary inquiry about having Dr. Jackson for an under secretary role last year, and the president spoke with him briefly about it then, one senior administration official said. But it went nowhere at the time. By Monday, Mr. Trump had started animatedly talking with a handful of people about the idea of Dr. Jackson’s replacing Dr. Shulkin, people familiar with the discussions said. Still, he did not tell many advisers of his plan until soon before it was announced. A Navy doctor since 1995, Dr. Jackson deployed as an emergency medicine physician to Taqaddum, Iraq, during the Iraq war. He has served as a member of the White House medical unit since 2006 and as its lead physician since 2013, overseeing Mr. Obama’s physicals. Dr. Jackson had told several people that he planned to retire from Washington after Mr. Obama left office. But Mr. Trump, whose previous personal physician made headlines with a series of unauthorized news interviews about his patient, asked Dr. Jackson to stay on. Mr. Trump, who goes to great lengths to hide details of his personal life, quickly came to trust Dr. Jackson, referring to him warmly as “Doc” around the White House. Democrats, moderate Republicans and mainline veterans groups have all feared that Dr. Shulkin’s departure could clear the way for a more aggressive push for government-subsidized private care at the department. “Every major veterans’ organization in this country vigorously opposes the privatization of the V.A.,” Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “I stand with them. Our job is to strengthen the V.A. in order to provide high-quality care to our veterans, not dismember it.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the rank of Dr. Ronny L. Jackson. He is a rear admiral, not an admiral.","WASHINGTON — After weeks of uncertainty atop the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Trump dismissed its secretary, David J.

He said he was not changing any other policy areas, including raising taxes or cutting spending. The president, who had been considering replacing Secretary Eric H. Holder Jr., is also expected to name another veteran to lead the department, which oversees more than 40 million people and $1 trillion in annual federal programs. But Mr. Trump, whose administration has faced criticism over staffing decisions, appears determined to make changes before they are necessary. In recent days, he has shown little inclination to change course when confronted by critics of his approach to mental illness, even though his own advisers say he understands the issue better than many others. His choice of Dr. Jackson, whom Republicans criticized last month for being too cozy with drug companies, came only hours after he named two new cabinet secretaries, Betsy DeVos of Michigan and Wilbur Ross of New York, to run the Education Department. Both men were chosen from lists of names submitted by Democrats who wanted them to be considered for the job. A day earlier, the Senate voted 52 to 47 against confirming Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee who has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault and harassment. And just before leaving for a speech in Ohio, Mr. Trump had hinted that he might consider nominating Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who has called the accusations unsubstantiated. The timing of Dr. Jackson’s selection, coming shortly after Mr. Trump met privately with several members of Congress and declared that he was making good on campaign promises to overhaul the nation’s entitlement system, raised questions about whether the president intended to follow through on those commitments. At least one person close to Mr. Trump expressed concern that the selections could backfire politically. “It seems like a bit of desperation to me,” said Representative Charlie Sykes, Democrat of Illinois, who was among several lawmakers who pressed Mr. Trump during their conversations to replace Ms. DeVos. “He’s trying to put together something big, but I don’t know if that will work.” As the government faces a continuing reckoning over how to pay for a sprawling array of programs, Mr. Trump’s choices signal a shift away from traditional Washington politics, where presidents often seek advice from lobbyists and corporate executives. Instead, Mr. Trump appears intent on using his executive authority to reshape the way the country spends money, and he has already made major cuts to agencies such as Medicare and Social Security. While the president has repeatedly said he wants to reduce spending, he has not always been clear about exactly what he intends to cut. Last week, he suggested eliminating all federal subsidies for low-income Americans and increasing tax rates on wealthy individuals. On Tuesday, he promised to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood clinics, saying they were part of a broader effort to curb abortion rights. Mr. Trump has vowed to protect American jobs and wages, but he has also said he would look into reducing regulations and easing trade barriers. For now, Mr. Trump appears focused on putting together a plan to save the military and rebuild America’s infrastructure. “I want to do everything we can to help our Military families,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning. “But most importantly, I want to keep our great Military strong!” He added: “We need a total & permanent re-up of WALL STREET for Border security and Dems must vote NO on Repealing Tax Reform. We cannot allow this horrible mess to continue!” Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a series of meetings with senior military leaders on Friday, according to three attendees of the event. Those talks will focus on ways to improve readiness and training of recruits, as well as ways to streamline procurement procedures to ensure that troops receive the best equipment. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has frequently boasted about building up the armed forces, telling supporters that he would increase troop numbers by 10 percent each year until he reached 100,000. Now, he is likely to use his powers of persuasion to promote policies that benefit his base, while avoiding fights with Democrats. “The military is very important to my agenda because it’s the backbone of our Country,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “And it’s the backbone of our economy. It’s very important.” Mr. Trump’s decision to nominate Dr. Jackson — a retired Army general who served in Iraq and Afghanistan — comes after months of speculation about his plans to fill a top Pentagon position. Several times since then, Mr. Trump has said that he would not make an announcement until he had made one for the State Department. But this week, Mr. Trump finally did so at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. In doing so, he showed himself willing to put aside personal animus and political considerations as he looks ahead to filling senior positions in the administration. The president-elect also signaled that he was open to making changes in the way the federal government does business if they were needed. He said he wanted to change how Congress spends money, saying that lawmakers should be forced to vote against spending increases when they don’t have enough votes to pass them. And he suggested that the Federal Reserve might need to raise interest rates more quickly than previously anticipated. “I am going to do everything I can to help you get things done, but we are living through some really tough economic times,” Mr. Trump said. “We have got to look at ways to lower taxes, and I will certainly consider lowering regulations. We have got to start looking at infrastructure, which is absolutely critical to us.” Mr. Trump’s selection of Dr. Jackson came hours before the Senate confirmed President Barack Obama’s choice, John Brennan, as the next C.I.A. director. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said he would wait to see what Mr. Trump did with the nomination. But he added: “It’s fair to say that there’s been a lot of talk about him being somebody that’s anti-Israel or something like that. That’s just not true.” The timing of Mr. Trump’s remarks on Tuesday could have significant implications on his ability to get legislation passed through Congress. If Mr. Trump chooses someone from outside the Beltway establishment, it could force Democrats to fight harder to block any bill that includes provisions they object to. At least two bills, including one by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, contain language that critics of Israel want included in a final agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians, according to people familiar with their negotiations. Some Republicans are already upset over those measures. They fear that the Palestinian Authority may use the new United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Gaza to try to undermine the talks and prevent a peace deal. A spokesman for Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the senator would not support such efforts. Mr. Trump also said he planned to meet privately with former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, whom he named as ambassador to South Korea, once he becomes president. Mr. Trump called Mr. Gates “a great guy” and praised his work ethic. “He’s smart and a good person,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s a hell of a guy.” Mr. Trump said he would consider naming another retired Marine general, James N. Mattis, as secretary of defense. But he said he would not name anyone else. His pick for the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, was chosen by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has clashed with Mr. Trump on several occasions. Mr. Trump said he would make the appointment, too. Mr. Trump said he would not name a cabinet member until he had decided whether he would run again for office. On Thursday, he was asked about his pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border, and said he would be open to discussing a trade deal with Mexico. “I think it’s going to happen,” he said. “I don’t know when it’s going to happen, but I think we’re going to do it.” He said that he would be open to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, though he added: “I don’t know why they didn’t negotiate it.” The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said that Mr. Trump would not comment on policy matters. But the president-elect has repeatedly hinted that he intends to take executive action on immigration, and he said on Monday that he would be considering expanding the number of H-1B visas available for workers in high-tech fields."
"Hundreds of Google employees, upset at the company’s decision to secretly build a censored version of its search engine for China, have signed a letter demanding more transparency to understand the ethical consequences of their work. In the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, employees wrote that the project and Google’s apparent willingness to abide by China’s censorship requirements “raise urgent moral and ethical issues.” They added, “Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment.” The letter is circulating on Google’s internal communication systems and is signed by about 1,400 employees, according to three people familiar with the document, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The internal activism presents another obstacle for Google’s potential return to China eight years after the company publicly withdrew from the country in protest of censorship and government hacking. China has the world’s largest internet audience but has frustrated American tech giants with content restrictions or outright blockages of services including Facebook and Instagram. It is also the latest example of how Google’s outspoken work force has agitated for changes to strategy. In April, the internet company’s employees spoke out against its involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to improve weaponry. By June, Google had said it would not renew a contract with the Pentagon for A.I. work. Google’s interest in bringing search back to China came to the forefront earlier this month, when reports surfaced that the company was working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing. The project, known internally as Dragonfly, was developed largely in secret, prompting outrage among employees who worried they had been unwittingly working on technology that would help China withhold information from its citizens. “We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we’re building,” the letter said. The letter also called on Google to allow employees to participate in ethical reviews of the company’s products, to appoint external representatives to ensure transparency and to publish an ethical assessment of controversial projects. The document referred to the situation as a code yellow, a process used in engineering to address critical problems that impact several teams. Google declined to comment on the letter. It has said in the past that it will not comment on Dragonfly or “speculation about future plans.” Late on Thursday, employees pressed Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and other management about Dragonfly at a weekly staff meeting. As of late Wednesday, one of the top questions on an internal software system called Dory, which lets employees vote for the queries that executives should answer at the meeting, asked whether Google had lost its ethical compass, said people who had reviewed the questions. Other questions on Dory asked directly about the Dragonfly project and specific information that may be censored by the Chinese government, such as air pollution data. “If we were to do our mission well, we are to think seriously about how to do more in China,” Mr. Pichai said in the staff meeting, audio of which was obtained by The Times. “That said, we are not close to launching a search product in China.” Mr. Pichai and Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, stopped answering questions about Dragonfly after seeing their answers posted on Twitter. This week’s staff meeting was the first opportunity for Google’s work force to ask executives about Dragonfly, because the meeting was not held last week. The absence of a gathering — the result of a regularly scheduled break in the summer, according to a company spokesman, Rob Shilkin — led to fears among employees that leadership was becoming less transparent following several controversies over Google’s government work. Google has traditionally been more responsive to employee concerns and more transparent about future projects and inner workings than other major technology companies, inviting questions from workers at its staff meetings and encouraging internal debate. The internal dissent over Dragonfly comes on the heels of the employee protests over Google’s involvement in the Pentagon project to use artificial intelligence. After Google said it would not renew its contract with the Pentagon, it unveiled a series of ethical principles governing its use of A.I. In those principles, Google publicly committed to use A.I. only in “socially beneficial” ways that would not cause harm and promised to develop its capabilities in accordance with human rights law. Some employees have raised concerns that helping China suppress the free flow of information would violate these new principles. In 2010, Google said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company’s corporate infrastructure in an attempt to access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. The attack, combined with government censorship, propelled Google to pull its search engine from the country. The exit from China was a seminal moment for the company — a symbol of its uncompromising idealism captured by Google’s unofficial motto of “Don’t Be Evil.” At the time, Chinese internet users marked the loss of Google’s search engine by laying flowers at the company’s Beijing offices in what became known as an “illegal flower tribute.” A possible re-entry to China, according to current and former employees, is a sign of a more mature and pragmatic company. Google has maintained a significant presence in China even though its flagship services are not accessible in the country. Last year, Google announced plans for a research center in China focused on artificial intelligence. And it has introduced translation and file management apps for the Chinese market. Google now has more than 700 employees in China. Google’s work on Dragonfly is not a guarantee that its search engine will be welcomed back to China. The government would have to approve its return and it has kept American technology firms like Facebook at arm’s length, opting instead to work closely with homegrown internet behemoths. Some employees are in favor of re-entering China, arguing that exiting the country in protest of censorship has done little to pressure Beijing to change its position while it has made Google nonessential among the world’s largest base of internet users. When Google pulled out of China in 2010, Mr. Brin said it objected to the country’s “totalitarian” policies when it came to censorship, political speech and internet communications. If anything, China has only tightened its controls in the last eight years — leaving the company in a bind for how to justify its return. “You can never satisfy a censor, particularly the ones in China,” said Charles Mok, member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council who advocates and represents the information technology sector and who is affiliated with the territory’s democratic camp. Google is probably facing intense pressure to introduce more of its products in China, Mr. Mok said, but added that the company would lend legitimacy to government censorship if it debuted a censored search product in China. “Then the Chinese government can say, ‘Google is O.K. with it, too,’” he said.","Hundreds of Google employees, upset at the company’s decision to secretly build a censored version of its search engine for China, have signed a letter demanding more transparency to understand the ethical consequences of their work. In the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, employees wrote that the project and Google’s apparent willingness to abide by China’s censorship requirements “raise urgent moral and ethical issues.” They added, “Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment.” The letter is circulating on Google’s internal communication systems and is signed by about 1,400 employees, according to three people familiar with the document, who were not authorized to speak publicly.","Hundreds of Google employees, upset at the company’s decision to secretly build a censored version of its search engine for China, have signed a letter demanding more transparency to understand the ethical consequences of their work.

It comes as many other tech companies are facing questions over whether they violated human rights in censoring Chinese Internet sites. A recent report from Amnesty International said Google had been accused of using its power to censor politically sensitive content to profit off users. In an email interview, Mr. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, denied any link between his company’s actions and those accusations. He also said he did not know why some employees were angry. “We don’t believe there has ever been a single instance where we have taken action against any individual employee or group of employees based on political views,” he said. But the letter suggests otherwise: While it does not name specific individuals, it accuses executives of being part of what critics call a culture of silence around speech critical of government policies. Some of the signers — including several former top engineers — say that they felt pressured into signing because of their concerns about the Chinese government’s treatment of dissidents. Others say they signed the letter out of frustration with a lack of transparency surrounding the project. Several prominent Google employees have spoken up since the controversy began last year, saying that the company should be more transparent about how it works with governments overseas. One engineer, Anthony Levandowski, left Google last year after allegations surfaced that he sexually harassed female subordinates. Another engineer, Eric Chien, quit Google last month after receiving death threats. Both men said they regretted leaving the company. The letter goes further than most employees’ public statements, raising serious questions about the ethics of the way Google conducts business. Many of the signers acknowledge that the project was built without approval from the U.S. State Department, but argue that it would never have happened if the government had approved it. The project was started in 2014, when Sergey Brin, then Google’s chief operating officer, told colleagues that he wanted to start building an international search engine for China, one that could be used to bypass censorship restrictions. At first, the plan seemed like a good idea: Build a homegrown alternative to Microsoft Bing, which was blocked in mainland China. But the team soon found itself struggling to get all the necessary approvals to begin construction, which included obtaining permission from local authorities. When officials finally gave their blessing, Google hired hundreds of workers to help finish the project, even though the site was still undergoing legal review. As the project continued to grow, so did concern over what appeared to be a growing rift between the United States and China over free expression. After the original announcement of the project in February 2015, the White House called it a “significant step forward” toward promoting democracy in China. But the project quickly became mired in controversy. On March 15, 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had begun censoring its results in China, effectively shutting down access to some sites. Two days later, the newspaper published another article about the project, this time describing how Google had forced employees to turn away visitors from certain websites. Soon afterward, Google announced that it would no longer allow anyone outside China to use the service. Now, the company says it wants to share more information about its activities. Last week, a group of 20 prominent technology leaders and scholars issued a statement condemning the project, calling it a violation of both American values and basic principles of freedom of speech. And earlier this month, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Democratic presidential nominee, called on Google to stop censoring Chinese Internet services. “I think it’s wrong that we are doing this,” Mr. Sanders said during an appearance on MSNBC. “This is something I think we need to look at very seriously, and I hope that the company will take steps to ensure that we can continue to have access to these tools.” The letter appears to echo similar calls made last summer by Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents exposing widespread surveillance by the agency. That leak prompted the Obama administration to impose sanctions on Google, requiring it to change its practices. Since then, the company has faced criticism from lawmakers, civil liberties groups and others concerned about the impact of its work in China. But critics say the letter is symptomatic of broader problems within Silicon Valley, especially in areas such as privacy, intellectual property and corporate responsibility. They point to the high-profile cases involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, two data mining firms that were acquired by Facebook before the release of the NSA’s trove of classified documents. Those deals raised new questions about whether Facebook and other social media platforms should be held responsible for the behavior of third parties. And they highlighted the tension between the tech industry’s desire to avoid negative publicity and the demands of regulators and politicians. For example, Facebook recently agreed to pay $5 billion to settle charges that it misled investors about privacy risks posed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It also paid a record fine last year for failing to disclose that one of its chief executives had been secretly recorded speaking with Russian officials. The settlement does not address how Facebook handled or responded to those recordings — which surfaced after news reports revealed their existence — nor did it resolve the question of what Facebook knew about them. “The reality is that we have an enormous amount of information that was collected in this country,” said David Zalesne, who led Facebook until 2012. “And there are so many people who don’t know where it came from, because they didn’t want to know.” That includes the government agencies that collect most of the personal data on American citizens: Social Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has long resisted calls for him to reveal more details about his company, including how much revenue he makes each quarter. He has argued instead that he needs to protect users’ private data. And he has refused requests by lawmakers, the public and others to make his business more transparent. Some lawmakers have suggested that the disclosures made by Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency, may help explain why Facebook chose not to share more information about itself. But Mr. Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea, saying that he would rather focus on building products that people love. “I think the best way to do that is to build something that you care about,” he told CNN recently. “We need to figure out how to make our product better than anyone else’s, and then figure out ways to do that.” At a time when technology companies are under intense scrutiny over leaks and revelations of questionable practices, some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley seem eager to keep quiet. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, declined to comment on the issue but did not deny that he had received a copy of the report. “We have no reason to believe that any of our systems are vulnerable to surveillance or hacking,” he wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “In fact, we encourage all of you to use encryption wherever possible.” Others at Facebook, like Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, and Robert A. Iger, Facebook’s president, have repeatedly insisted that the company is in good standing with the government. On Wednesday, Ms. Sandberg, a Harvard graduate, appeared on CNBC to defend her role in helping create Facebook. She said she had never met Mr. Snowden and had no knowledge of his activities. “We do not discuss individual employees’ privacy issues,” she said. “We do not discuss individuals’ privacy rights, nor do we discuss the collection or misuse of personal information. We do not discuss the balance of power between governments and corporations.” And while Mr. Iger, the executive vice chairman, has said he knows nothing about the Cambridge Analytica case, he has gone further, describing himself as a libertarian. “You can’t tell me what to do with my own life without knowing my history,” he said in an interview. “I am very open with the world. I am very open with the rest of the world.” Mr. Zuckerberg said he had received a copy of the report from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. “I am not going to answer any questions about this matter,” he said. “This is about protecting people’s right to privacy.” Many Silicon Valley leaders, though, see the controversy as another manifestation of the growing conflict between the tech industry and Congress over regulation of big tech. After years of bipartisan support for tougher regulations, the debate has intensified since President Obama took office, with Republicans demanding stronger oversight. Last week, lawmakers proposed sweeping changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, making it less likely that the court will approve surveillance warrants. Democrats are also considering legislation that could require companies to disclose more about how they handle customer data."
"Without a trace of bitterness, the billionaire Stephen A. Wynn once described his divorce from Elaine P. Wynn as the most expensive in American history. They evenly split his stake in the casino-resort company they co-founded and seemed to remain compatible leaders of some of the most profitable hotel-casinos in the world. Now that amicability itself may be history — and the fate of the $13 billion enterprise they built together could hang in the balance. After Ms. Wynn filed suit to lift divorce-related restrictions on the sale of her stock, fellow board members voted this month against nominating her for another term — despite her status as a co-founder, the third-largest shareholder and the only director who is not a white man. The board said it was eliminating her seat and is recommending retention of two other directors to the seats they now hold. Ms. Wynn, 72, has countered with a direct appeal to shareholders, urging them to choose her, instead, for one of the two remaining seats. The results of the vote will be announced at an April 24 shareholder meeting in Las Vegas, four days before the 10th anniversary of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, which is also her birthday. On Monday in New York she accelerated an already extraordinary public relations campaign, outlining a schedule of meetings with institutional investors on Wall Street who will vote in the proxy battle. She is challenging claims by the company’s governance committee that she has conflicts of interest and lacks the independence necessary to work in the best interest of shareholders. “I am the DNA of Wynn Resorts,” said Ms. Wynn, who has retained the proxy specialist firm Abernathy MacGregor and a Democratic political consultant, Mark D. Fabiani. On Friday she opened a website, elaineforwynn.com, which urges her re-election as a “co-founder, industry veteran and independent voice.” “Anybody that has a scintilla of knowledge about my history and my working relationship” with Mr. Wynn, she said in her first interview about the dispute, “knows the vital role that I play.”  “If you take me out of the mix, there’s no one at the company who has any kind of operational history in depth that I do,” she said. The fight is in sharp contrast to the immediate aftermath of her January 2010 divorce from Mr. Wynn, 73, the chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts Ltd., after 46 years of marriage. At that time, the two made much of how amicable their dissolution had been by pointing out he had agreed without a fight to give her half of his stake in the company, as well as various real estate holdings and her pick of their celebrated art collection. The move turned her into a billionaire in her own right. She was no mere corporate wife, Mr. Wynn said then, but a critical part of the company’s success. “We’re still partners in the business; I respect and value and really covet her opinion on issues,” he said in March 2010. “She has a real feel for the business that’s terrific.” Yet that agreement also restricted both Wynns from selling any shares of the company without the other’s consent and requires them to vote in concert, although Ms. Wynn received a waiver to sell $10 million worth of stock per year. Each owned about $1.3 billion in stock as of the market’s close on Monday. The stock has nearly doubled since their divorce, with the company’s market capitalization estimated at $13.2 billion.  In 2012 Ms. Wynn sued her ex-husband in federal court to alter their arrangement and give her the power to sell her shares at will. The two own a combined 19.3 percent of the company, with the investment firm T. Rowe Price holding the next largest share at about 16.8 percent. The fear is that should Ms. Wynn be allowed to sell as much of her stock as she wishes, the couple could lose their controlling interest and Mr. Wynn’s authority over the company could be jeopardized. Ms. Wynn’s continuing lawsuit and apparent desire to sell make her unsuitable for board service because they show her to be acting out of self-interest and not the company’s interest, said Robert J. Miller, chairman of the board’s governance committee. He noted that Ms. Wynn had sold the $10 million in stock she has been permitted to sell every year. “In meetings with Ms. Wynn, she was consistently unable to indicate how her lawsuit benefited any other shareholder, while putting the company and other shareholders’ interests at risk,” Mr. Miller, a Democratic former governor of Nevada and longtime friend of both Wynns, said in an interview. “From an independent director’s vantage point,” he said, “our obligation is to review any candidacy based on the best interests of the overall shareholders themselves.” Ms. Wynn has said that she has no intention of setting off a power shift but that she wishes to gain control over her assets and may wish to sell some piece of her holdings to fund her philanthropic efforts. Mr. Wynn declined to comment. Because the shareholder agreement remains in effect, Mr. Wynn is contractually obligated to support her candidacy to remain on the board regardless of his personal wishes. She begins her proxy battle, then, with about 19.3 percent of the vote in a three-way race for two seats, so her fate largely depends on investors like Price and seven other firms that combined hold 37.7 percent of the company. Aside from Ms. Wynn, the company’s board is entirely composed of white men, a peculiarity in this age of diversity on corporate boards and an angle Ms. Wynn is aggressively pursuing in her campaign. By contrast, MGM Resorts International, a gambling company of similar market capitalization, has three women on its board, including one who is African-American, as well as Roland Hernandez, a Latino, who is the former chief executive of Telemundo. The issue of diversity could be potent, some experts said, considering that the company is part of the hospitality industry and studies have shown women are the primary decision makers when it comes to travel plans. “It may resonate as an important issue because there are so few women on boards and the standard reason is that there aren’t women who have been in executive positions in whatever industry for 30 years or so, but in this case you have a woman with such exceptional experience,” said Erik Gordon, a corporate governance expert at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. A Wynn spokesman, Michael Weaver, said that Wynn Resorts “is engaged in a search for women and other diverse candidates and will expand the board with at least one qualified candidate by the end of the year.” While Ms. Wynn points to her renomination in 2012, after she filed her lawsuit against Mr. Wynn, as evidence that concerns about her independence and board performance are new, personal and unfounded, the corporate governance firm Glass, Lewis & Company recommended against her reappointment then. Given her legal dispute with Mr. Wynn, “we believe her continued presence on the board may prove to distract the other directors from carrying out their duties to shareholders,” the firm said in part. Ms. Wynn had not been aware of that report until Monday. A different assessment, from Institutional Shareholder Services in 2012, recommended that she be reappointed. Since her divorce, Ms. Wynn has been almost entirely focused on philanthropic work. She is the chairwoman of Communities in Schools, a nationwide high school dropout prevention program. In 2013 she was appointed to the Nevada Board of Education by Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican; she is now its president. She also drew attention by purchasing a Francis Bacon triptych for $142.4 million last November, then having it shipped not to her Las Vegas home but to Oregon, a move that allowed her to potentially avoid a $11 million state tax bill for the purchase. Last year, after a review of executive compensation requested by Institutional Shareholder Services, the company changed its pay packages to lower Mr. Wynn’s base salary, limit his use of the corporate jet and issue half of his bonus in stock. Mr. Wynn asked Ms. Wynn to grant him a waiver to sell the stock he received in that package, but she refused. He claimed that she told him she wanted to use the stock as leverage over him, according to sources close to Mr. Wynn. In an interview, she declined to say whether the anecdote was true, but said that her current relationship with Mr. Wynn was far from hostile. She said he still called her to discuss business, family and politics, and recently he left her a voice mail message complimenting her on her oversight of the design of staff uniforms for the new casino property in Macau. “The conflict that may be created in the boardroom is not coming from Elaine Wynn,” she said. “Elaine Wynn is the no-drama queen.” The company has indicated it will fight Ms. Wynn’s campaign in big and small ways that include prohibiting her from using the corporate logo on her website. When the site opened on Friday, the logo was used in place of her last name; over the weekend, after a stern letter from the company’s lawyers, her name was fully written in her own hand. “The company reminded Ms. Wynn that company trademarks are reserved for company business,” Mr. Weaver, the Wynn Resorts spokesman, said. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the opening date of the Encore hotel. It opened in 2008; it is not opening next week.","Without a trace of bitterness, the billionaire Stephen A. Wynn once described his divorce from Elaine P.

Wynn once described his divorce from Elaine P. Wynn as the most expensive in American history. They evenly split his stake in the casino-resort company they co-founded and seemed to remain compatible leaders of some of the most profitable hotel-casinos in the world.. But Ms. Wynn’s relationship with Mr. Wynn was rocky for years, and he eventually left her for another woman — one who would soon be known as “Mrs. Steve.” She filed for divorce last year after months of allegations that she had been unfaithful to him by sleeping with other men, including two bodyguards hired by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. The couple married on Sept. 19, 2000, at St. John’s Roman Catholic Church in Las Vegas, where Mr. Wynn is buried. Their marriage has never been legally recognized, but it remains an enduring symbol of their union, which lasted more than seven decades. It also became a subject of intense speculation about what might have happened if Mrs. Wynn had not wed Mr. Wynn. In recent weeks, there were reports that Mr. Wynn was considering taking steps against her. He was quoted as saying: “I am not going to stand here and defend my wife when I know that this has been going on for so long.” For many people, it is difficult to imagine how such a marriage could ever have worked out, given the personalities involved. Yet it did. Mr. Wynn and Ms. Wynn met at age 19 and began dating in 1990, according to court records. After several years together, they decided to marry in 1999. They married for 50 days before divorcing in 2001. The marriage ended in divorce in 2012. “It was a very happy marriage,” said David Tisch, the chief executive of the Wynn Resorts family, referring to Mr. Wynn’s first marriage. “We were both very much into our careers. We had good jobs. There was no bad blood between us.” “They loved each other dearly,” added Paul Ruddy, who served as chairman of the board of Wynn Resorts and its predecessor companies until 2013. “They were friends, and we’d see them every weekend.” Mr. Wynn died in May 2014, just hours after being released from prison following a plea deal. Ms. Wynn remained in touch with Mr. Trump throughout her life, even as he pursued other women. In 2008, she told People magazine that she had been sleeping with Mr. Trump since 1998. When asked in November 2015 whether she still had any contact with Mr. Trump, she replied, “No.” She also denied having slept with him again in 2016, shortly after Mr. Trump won the presidency. His lawyers have said that he had nothing to do with the accusations of infidelity. “The fact that he has made statements like that is unfortunate,” said William S. Zartman, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer. “But I think it speaks volumes to the state of affairs he has in his life.” Mr. Wynn’s business empire included casinos, hotels and resorts, real estate development and golf courses, along with numerous television stations, newspapers and magazines. He built up the Trump Organization over nearly three decades, building it to become one of the largest privately held companies in America. In 1987, he sold off all his holdings in the company and went public, becoming a major player in the financial markets. Since then, he has accumulated $2 billion worth of assets, according to Forbes magazine. His wealth grew steadily through the early 2000s, and by 2007, he was worth roughly $1.5 billion. By 2011, he was worth $3.4 billion. But by 2014, he was worth close to $6 billion. At the height of the dot-com boom, he was worth close to $10 billion. He earned billions in income from those investments, as well as millions from his resort holdings. As the value of his stakes soared, so too did the value of his homes. He owned vast tracts of land in Florida, California, Nevada and Arizona, among others. And he had a private jet, a helicopter and a yacht that he used regularly. He had a reputation as a philanthropist, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to charity. His fortune was estimated to be around $1.8 billion by Bloomberg News. Ms. Wynn, a former Playboy Playmate, has been married twice, first to Michael B. Jordan, and later to Jeff Bridges, a musician. She was divorced from Mr. Jordan in 2006. Her second husband, Robert Linder, was killed in a car accident in 2009. She and Mr. Wynn are survived by four children. Mr. Trump himself has said that he does not believe Ms. Wynn cheated on him, although he has repeatedly called her “the most beautiful woman in the world.” During the campaign, he has repeatedly suggested that she was a con artist who took advantage of his generosity to make millions for herself. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said: “I don’t think it would be fair to say I don’t know if there is any truth to what she says about me. But I do know that she is a very dishonest person, and she is trying to take advantage of people. And I have been very generous to her.” He added: “She is doing this because she knows it will work, and she knows it will be good for business.” On Thursday evening, Mrs. Wynn released a statement saying that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer after undergoing chemotherapy. Her family said they were grateful that someone else could step forward to help them through their difficult time. In a series of tweets late Friday night, Mr. Trump wrote: “I am so happy that my friend @HillaryClinton has finally decided to run again! It never ends!” Mrs. Clinton’s decision to run for president comes as Mr. Trump continues to struggle to find a running mate willing to challenge him for the Republican nomination. Several candidates, including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker, have expressed interest in running. Some Republicans have speculated that Mrs. Clinton may want to stay out of politics until after the election. Others have questioned whether she can win over enough voters to overcome Mr. Trump’s formidable political organization. Still others have pointed to Mr. Trump’s personal history as evidence that he cannot be trusted to serve as a general-election candidate. In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has struggled to gain traction among African-Americans, many of whom view her as too inexperienced and insufficiently liberal. A poll last week showed her trailing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by double digits in black communities. For months, Mrs. Clinton has insisted that she has no intention of becoming a surrogate for Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. Now that he appears to be gaining momentum, Mrs. Clinton is taking steps to try to regain some footing. Last month, she held two town hall-style events in Pennsylvania, where she spoke at length about health care issues and paid a visit to one hospital. This past weekend, Mrs. Clinton hosted another event, which included questions from reporters, but did not address specific policy proposals. At both events, Mrs. Clinton spoke glowingly about President Obama and praised Hillary Rodham Clinton as a leader for women. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, also attended the second event. While Mr. Trump has yet to endorse a Democratic nominee, Mrs. Clinton has made clear that she intends to support Democrats in November. “The Clintons are going to go down as the greatest generation,” Mrs. Clinton told CNN last year, adding that she hoped the party would nominate a Democrat “who doesn’t just talk the way Donald Trump talks.” In a speech at West Point University in Virginia on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton said that she intended to “make sure that every single American gets access to quality education, opportunity and security.” “We need a government that works for everyone,” she said. “That’s why we need a commander in chief who understands our country’s role in the world, who cares deeply about our military families, and who believes passionately that America must lead in everything it does — including its economic and diplomatic relationships around the globe.” On Wednesday morning, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to hold a news conference in Washington, D.C., before flying to Florida. Mrs. Clinton said that she wanted to answer questions from reporters in advance of the trip. “I want to be prepared,” she said."
"Raising the prospect of lasting fissures in the party, Senator Bernie Sanders rebuffed pressure on Tuesday to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada, throwing chairs and later threatening the state chairwoman in a fight over delegates. The uproar comes as Hillary Clinton is struggling to turn her and the party’s attention to the fall. Mr. Sanders’s supporters showed no sign of backing down on Tuesday. In interviews, several threatened to disrupt the party’s convention in Philadelphia in July with protests and nonviolent disobedience over a nominating system that they say has treated Mr. Sanders unfairly. In emails, on social media and on websites, his supporters have traded advice about protest tactics and legal services in case of mass arrests. Alarmed by the unrest in Nevada, Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, said that he spoke with Mr. Sanders on Tuesday and that the Vermont senator faced a “test of leadership” over his supporters’ actions. Mr. Reid, who represents Nevada, said he was confident that Mr. Sanders would “do the right thing.” But Mr. Sanders showed no sign of backing down, releasing a statement that, while condemning violence, accused the Democratic leadership in Nevada of using “its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place.” The fight in Nevada underscored the determination of Mr. Sanders’s supporters to undermine Mrs. Clinton’s all-but-certain march to the nomination. On Tuesday she lost the Oregon primary but declared victory in Kentucky, where she held a 1,900-vote edge according to complete but unofficial returns. Mrs. Clinton spent Monday campaigning in Kentucky, showing how the battle against Mr. Sanders continues to distract her campaign even as she turns her fire on Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. And leading Democrats have become increasingly vocal about the need to unify the party for the general election — while being careful not to anger Mr. Sanders by urging him to quit the race. Senator Barbara Boxer of California said she had reached out to Mr. Sanders about the need for unity. “I have placed a couple of calls to Bernie,” Ms. Boxer said. “He’s my friend. He’s been my friend for many, many, many years, and I haven’t heard back from Bernie, and I would hope that Bernie will be a leader and make sure that everybody understands what is at stake. And what is at stake is the future of our nation. Nothing less.” Ms. Boxer, who was in Nevada for the convention on Saturday as Sanders supporters erupted in anger, called what she witnessed ”terrible.” “We just can’t have a repeat of that in Philadelphia because it’s distressing,” Ms. Boxer said. “I have a message to the Bernie people who are planning to be disobedient because the system is rigged. Here is the thing: They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most votes. They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most delegates. There is nothing to protest.” But Sanders supporters remained defiant, raising the possibility of unrest on the streets outside the convention. “You are going to see a variety of tactics,” said Elizabeth Arnold, 32, a former staff member for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia who said she planned to demonstrate. “I personally don’t like being arrested. But it’s essential that we speak our minds and assert our First Amendment rights. Our system is terribly flawed and terribly unjust — so very just actions often end in arrests.” Ms. Arnold, who helped found EDGE, an environmental justice group based in Philadelphia, said she did not condone violence and hoped that people would find a way to voice concerns peacefully. But she said that Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic leaders attending the convention “should worry about what is going to happen.” Nina Turner, a prominent surrogate for Mr. Sanders, said that she had seen several emails from people planning acts of civil disobedience, and that talk of dissent in the Republican ranks over Mr. Trump masked the searing divisions among Democrats. “People are talking about the Republicans having a brokered convention. I think we are sleeping on the Democrats,” Ms. Turner said. “And if Democrats believe that that’s not going to happen, they are just sadly mistaken. They have blinders on.” “It is going to be progressives who will disrupt,” she said. “And when I say disrupt, I don’t mean in a violent or a terrible way, but I just mean upset the apple cart.” April Mellody, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Convention, said in a statement that the convention’s security team would work with the Philadelphia police and the Secret Service “to ensure the safety and security of all of our delegates and participants.” After the meeting of Nevada Democrats on Saturday ended in mayhem when many potential Sanders delegates were deemed ineligible, Roberta Lange, the state party chairwoman, said she had received death threats against her and her family after Sanders supporters spread her cellphone number online. “The Sanders campaign helped incite everything that happened,” she said. “Instead of attacking me, they should be publicly apologizing to me for the part that they played. I’m really disappointed. It makes me feel like it is not being taken seriously.” On Tuesday, the Nevada State Democratic Party issued a formal complaint to the Democratic National Committee in response to the behavior of Mr. Sanders’s supporters. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the national party chairwoman, also expressed her concern Tuesday. “We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas,” she said. But the protest effort enjoys some institutional support. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union that has endorsed Mr. Sanders and that has been busing its members across the country to campaign for him, also said her group planned to take part in demonstrations at the convention. “We will be a significant force inside and a significant force outside,” she said. “The focus is going to be how disenfranchised the voters felt during this election by the D.N.C.” An article on Wednesday about pressure that Democratic officials are putting on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada misidentified, in some editions, the Senate leadership job held by Harry Reid. He is the minority leader — not the majority leader, the post held by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.","Raising the prospect of lasting fissures in the party, Senator Bernie Sanders rebuffed pressure on Tuesday to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada, throwing chairs and later threatening the state chairwoman in a fight over delegates.

The uproar comes as Hillary Clinton is struggling to turn her and the party’s attention to the fall. campaign. “We have to take care of our people first,” Mr. Sanders said at an event here. He was speaking with Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, who has been critical of Mr. Sanders, but not hostile. “I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what happened tonight,” he said. “But I want to make sure that we all understand that this was a very small group of individuals who had no intention of disrupting anything. They were simply trying to vent their frustrations and get some good old-fashioned political action.” Mr. Sanders has long held up his visit to Las Vegas — where he delivered remarks about free college tuition and economic justice before hundreds of thousands of attendees — as evidence that he could win over disenchanted Democrats. But Mr. Sanders also made clear that he did not plan to back down from his criticism of Mrs. Clinton, saying she had failed to meet the standards of equality that he says are necessary to restore American democracy. In an interview with CNN, he also suggested that Mrs. Clinton had exaggerated the size of her lead against Donald J. Trump by several percentage points. “It’s not fair to say that she won the popular vote because there was fraud,” Mr. Sanders told the network. “The truth is, if you look at the results, they didn’t even come close.” On Monday night, Mr. Sanders called for the resignation of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, whom he accused of being part of a corrupt establishment that had rigged the system in favor of Wall Street banks and other corporations. “John Kasich should resign immediately,” Mr. Sanders said. “He’s got a conflict of interest problem.” Mr. Kasich’s office declined to comment on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Mr. Kasich said that the governor would not discuss his views publicly. Mr. Kasich, who is running for re-election in Ohio next year, has been dogged by questions about whether he has broken any laws or ethics rules while serving as governor. He has refused to answer questions from reporters, including one last week when he appeared to suggest that Mr. Sanders might have been born outside the United States. He has also repeatedly denied having received money from lobbyists or special interests. Mr. Sanders’s comments came during a contentious debate between him and Mrs. Clinton, which lasted more than four hours. Both candidates tried to draw contrasts with each other, but they often clashed over policy issues like health care, education and climate change. And both candidates accused each other of playing fast and loose with facts in order to score cheap media hits. At times, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be mocking Mr. Sanders’s proposals, such as his proposal to raise taxes on wealthy Americans. She called him out for proposing to pay for universal prekindergarten, a program that Mr. Sanders opposes. As the two engaged in the most intense exchanges yet, Mrs. Clinton struggled to find a way to break through. Her advisers acknowledged that the party was facing an unprecedented crisis: With just days left until Election Day, the Republican presidential nominee is already losing support among moderate voters, many of them white working class men and women who have turned away from Mr. Trump. Many of those voters, she conceded, will never go to the polls again. The Democratic Party’s leaders were determined to avoid a repeat of 2008, when Mrs. Clinton lost the nomination to Barack Obama. Instead, they decided to try to rebuild a party that can appeal to young voters, minorities and independents. Ms. Clinton’s team is still trying to figure out how to do that. But on Wednesday morning, the president of the United States, a Democrat, offered a stark warning to Republicans: If you don’t start paying your bills, you’ll get nothing. “You’re going to see us doing everything we can to help folks keep their homes,” Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House speaker, declared at the annual meeting of the National Association of Social Workers. “If you’re not making enough to cover basic expenses, then you’re going to lose jobs. You’re going to lose wages. We’re going to see you getting less benefits. You’re going to see us cutting back on Medicaid.” The message, delivered by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., underscored the challenge of turning around a once solidly conservative party. “It’s hard to believe that we are a decade into this century,” Mr. Biden said. “And we’ve already seen a lot of progress. There’s been huge changes in terms of the economy. It’s true that a lot of people have lost jobs but I think there has also been some real progress in terms of raising incomes for working families and it’s very important that we continue to make those gains.” The Democratic presidential candidates were quick to praise President Obama as they made their way through an hourlong debate on Thursday night at George Washington University in Virginia. They called him “the best job creator since Abraham Lincoln” and declared that he was transforming American society by making government work better. But they also acknowledged that his record was not perfect. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called the Affordable Care Act “a disaster” and vowed to dismantle it if elected president. He did not mention the name of one Republican who had voted against it. And he criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting the Iraq war, which she had opposed. “I don’t know how you can vote for someone who supported the invasion of Iraq when you know that over 60 percent of Americans do not support the war,” Mr. Sanders said. “But I will tell you what: We need a new direction.” Mr. Obama was asked about the criticism from Republicans. “The fact is, I was elected twice by two-thirds majorities of the Congress,” he said. “We cannot afford to be debating whether or not we should get rid of Obamacare.” He added, “We have got to figure out how to grow our economy without destroying it.” But Mr. Obama said the country would not be able to pay off its debt until after 2030. That was far less than many Democrats expected. In the end, he conceded that the United States could not keep paying down its debts. “Our priorities must change,” he said. “That means spending more time focused on education, health care, infrastructure and other things that really matter to people.” Mr. McCain took aim at Mrs. Clinton for her role in the 2008 election. “She played a major role in helping Barack Obama win the presidency because she knew that a Democrat was going to take control of the House next year,” he said. “Hillary Clinton does not want to raise taxes on middle class families. She wants to cut Social Security benefits for retirees. She supports free college tuition for all children.” In contrast to the attacks on Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McCain said that he wanted to see the nation’s tax code overhauled so that it would encourage investment in America’s future. “This is not just my view; it’s the view of every member of Congress,” he said. “We need to rethink what we call corporate welfare.” He added, “We need to consider the possibility that corporations might be required to share profits with workers, like farmers in Wisconsin.” Mr. Romney said the United States needed to move away from being “a global leader in the world,” adding, “The world needs to realize that if we don’t act decisively, then others will catch up to us.” “If we don’t start acting decisively, then we will find ourselves behind China and India,” he said. Mr. Trump said the United States had “turned our backs on God” and that he had told evangelical leaders that they would never again receive preferential treatment under federal law. “I said it before and I say it now — I am going to stop playing games with evangelicals,” he said. “They are losing millions of dollars, and they have no idea why.” Mr. Ryan pointed out that Mr. Obama had promised during his campaign that he would create 50 million jobs. “President Obama has failed to deliver on that promise,” he said. “He has created only 23 million jobs since taking office.” Mr. Rubio said he wanted to improve economic conditions for low-income residents. “This is not a partisan issue,” he said. “I am here today to talk about opportunity, not poverty.” Mr. Cruz said the United States had become too dependent on foreign oil, saying it had led to a “crisis of civilization.” “We are running out of options,” he said. “We are running out of ways to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.” He said that climate change posed a national security threat and that it threatened the stability of international trade agreements."
"For Dr. Dre, this summer was meant to be a victory lap in a successful career. “Straight Outta Compton,” a biopic about his hip-hop group, N.W.A., topped the box office last week with a $56.1 million opening. “Compton,” his first album in 16 years, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard chart. Last year, the music company that Dr. Dre helped establish, Beats, was sold to Apple for $3 billion, making him the self-proclaimed “first billionaire in hip-hop.”  But critics charge that the movie, which was co-produced by Dr. Dre, glosses over N.W.A.’s record of misogyny and ignores Dr. Dre’s history of physically abusing women. In a sign that the uproar was threatening not only his reputation but also his business dealings, Dr. Dre, who has previously spoken dismissively or vaguely about the decades-old episodes, confronted them on Friday in a statement to The New York Times. While he did not address each allegation individually, he said: “Twenty-five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I’ve been married for 19 years and every day I’m working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I’m doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again.” He added: “I apologize to the women I’ve hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.” Apple, where Dr. Dre, 50, now works as a top consultant, also issued a statement: “Dre has apologized for the mistakes he’s made in the past and he’s said that he’s not the same person that he was 25 years ago. We believe his sincerity and after working with him for a year and a half, we have every reason to believe that he has changed.”  This is the latest case of a celebrity who, partly because of the Internet, has been forced to face old abuse allegations. And for the accusers, Dr. Dre’s statement may be an acknowledgment of what they said decades ago.  In interviews with The Times this week, the women at the center of the allegations — the hip-hop journalist Dee Barnes; Michel’le, an R&B singer and Dr. Dre’s former girlfriend; and Tairrie B, a onetime labelmate — spoke about the abuse and about how social media had helped them connect and spread their stories.  “I’ve been talking about my abuse for many, many years, but it has not gotten any ears until now,” said Michel’le, who was romantically involved with Dr. Dre from the late-’80s until the mid-’90s. (They have an adult son.)  During that time, she said, he was often physically abusive, hitting her with a closed fist and leaving “black eyes, a cracked rib and scars.” Michel’le said she never pressed charges because, “We don’t get that kind of education in my culture.” She added, “Opening up and finding out there were other women like me gave me the power to speak up.”  Tairrie B, a.k.a Tairrie B. Murphy, said that Dr. Dre punched her twice in the face at a Grammys after-party in 1990 after she recorded a track insulting him.  She connected with Ms. Barnes through Facebook last year. “I said, ‘Hey girl, I think we have something in common, and we’ve never talked about it,’ ” Ms. Murphy said.  Ms. Barnes recalled being brought to tears by that message and a subsequent hourslong phone conversation with Ms. Murphy. Both women were writing memoirs — Ms. Barnes’s is tentatively titled “Music, Myth and Misogyny” — but did not expect to wage a public campaign against Dr. Dre, she said.  “The initial conversation was like group therapy, to heal our wounds,” Ms. Barnes said.  As the Aug. 14 release of “Straight Outta Compton” approached, others started the discussion. A blog post from last year by the rap writer Byron Crawford, titled “Beatings by Dre,” began to circulate again on Twitter and Facebook, while a Gawker post headlined “Remember When Dr. Dre Bashed a Female Journalist’s Face Against a Wall?” was published on July 31 and was viewed nearly 300,000 times. (In format, it mirrored a Gawker article from early 2014: “Who Wants to Remember Bill Cosby’s Multiple Sex-Assault Accusations?”)  At a panel for “Straight Outta Compton” this month, the film’s director, F. Gary Gray, was asked why the film omitted Ms. Barnes’s story, in which Dr. Dre confronted her at a party in 1991 about an N.W.A. segment on her Fox show “Pump It Up!”  According to a statement Ms. Barnes issued at the time, Dr. Dre began punching her in the head and “slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall.” (Charged with assault and battery, he pleaded no contest. He was sentenced to community service and probation, fined $2,500 and ordered to make a domestic violence P.S.A.; a civil suit was settled out of court.) Mr. Gray said at the panel that the filmmakers had “talked about it at the beginning” — the scene appeared in an early script — but ultimately decided the movie “wasn’t about a lot of side stories.” He added, “You can make five different N.W.A. movies — we made the one we wanted to make.” (Through Universal Studios, Mr. Gray declined to comment.) Sensing the renewed interest, Ms. Murphy encouraged Ms. Barnes to tell her side. “It’s about finally getting the truth out there,” Ms. Murphy said.  On Tuesday, Ms. Barnes published an essay on Gawker about the film and her assault that was seen more than 1.6 million times. “I suffer from horrific migraines that started only after the attack,” she wrote. “My head does ring and it hurts, exactly in the same spot every time where he smashed my head against the wall.”  She called the movie “revisionist history,” lamenting the women, including Ms. Murphy and Michel’le, who were written out. The movie “wasn’t reality and it wasn’t gangster,” Ms. Barnes said. “Gangster would have been to show everything.” As a white, female rapper signed to Ruthless Records, N.W.A.’s record label, Ms. Murphy said she had been expected to collaborate with Dr. Dre, but resisted his creative control. “He was very nasty to me constantly,” she said, and so she decided to address his chauvinism on the song “Ruthless Bitch.”  When Dr. Dre said at a crowded party that he’d heard the track, the pair began arguing. “I stood up to him, and I didn’t back down,” Ms. Murphy said. “He kept saying, ‘If you say one more word to me ...” Then, she said, “he punched me right in the mouth and again in the eye.”  While Ms. Murphy did not file a police report — “There’s no excuse, but this was a different time,” she said — a meeting was scheduled the next day with Eazy-E, a founder of N.W.A., and Jerry Heller, N.W.A.’s manager and a founder of Ruthless. “I was told, ‘This is a family business — you’re not pressing charges,” she said. “I was taken care of by Eazy in certain ways to be quiet.” (Mr. Heller did not respond to requests for comment. Eazy-E died in 1995.)  After Ms. Murphy reconnected with Ms. Barnes, “I had a lot of guilt,” she said. “Had I pressed charges, he would have had a strike against him. And maybe Michel’le would have stood up, too. Maybe it would have made him think.”  Since the attack, Ms. Barnes said that she has had trouble finding work in the entertainment industry: “His career continued, where mine dwindled. People side with the money.” Still, she rejects those who say coming forward again now is opportunistic. “What opportunity?” she said. “Show me the opportunities.”  She added, “They brought up the past” by making the film. “Not me.” Michel’le agreed. “They told their story,” she said. “I’m telling mine.”","For Dr. Dre, this summer was meant to be a victory lap in a successful career. “Straight Outta Compton,” a biopic about his hip-hop group, N.W.A., topped the box office last week with a $56.1 million opening.","For Dr. Dre, this summer was meant to be a victory lap in a successful career. “Straight Outta Compton,” a biopic about his hip-hop group, N.W.A., topped the box office last week with a $56.1 million opening. weekend that included an estimated $15 million for its star, Ice Cube. But after months of delays and setbacks, it seems as if Mr. Cube is not going to get everything he wants out of the movie — or at least the money. The film has been plagued by problems since its release in June, including casting questions over whether Snoop Dogg could play the role of Biggie Smalls, the gangster whose life he chronicled in his book Straight Up: My Life Inside America’s Most Notorious Gang. And now, according to several people familiar with Mr. Cube’s plans, he may have decided against playing himself in the film because he did not want to appear on camera while wearing blackface. In fact, some members of the cast say they were told not to participate in any interviews, either before or during filming, to avoid being identified as African-Americans. The decision to make the movie without Mr. Cube was first reported by TMZ, which said that Mr. Cube had asked producers not to include him in interviews. He also refused to allow anyone from his camp to speak with reporters, although those who spoke with him were allowed to do so. After all, Mr. Cube, 52, has spent decades trying to break into Hollywood. His breakthrough came when he landed a cameo in 1992’s Dream Warriors, in which he played one of two men killed during a shootout between police officers in New York City. Since then, he has appeared in films like Get Shorty (2000), Last Action Hero (2003) and Gotti 2 (2006). And despite his reputation as a rap artist, he has never acted. Yet critics say his appearance in Straight Outta Compton — a biopic about N.W.A., which stars Ice Cube and features music videos from such artists as Jay Z and Nas — is problematic because he does not look African-American. On Saturday night, Mr. Cube tweeted, “I am no longer interested in acting,” adding, “I will not be appearing in any interviews or speaking to the media. I am not interested in having my face shown on screen.” The tweet was accompanied by another message from Mr. Cube, saying, “I am not interested in talking about me as a person. That would be disrespectful.” A representative for Mr. Cube declined to comment. It remains unclear why Mr. Cube chose not to act, but there are reports that he had reservations about portraying himself in the movie. One member of his crew said Mr. Cube told them not to talk to the press because he wanted to keep his identity private. Another said he told Mr. Cube, “If you want to use your name, go ahead. You can call yourself whatever you want. Just don’t call us niggers.” Mr. Cube was interviewed by CNN last month and denied that he had made up the story about his ethnicity. He insisted that he was simply referring to his ethnicity as a rapper, rather than African-American. Asked whether he regretted making the statement, he responded, “No. No regrets. Nothing.” Still, many in the industry believe that Mr. Cube was telling the truth, given what happened in the past. Mr. Cube has long been known for his outspokenness, and he has spoken publicly about racial issues before. At the time of Straight Outta Compton’s release, Mr. Cube was facing accusations that he had used cocaine and alcohol, and he was also accused of sexually assaulting women. Those allegations were dropped in 2005. But even though Mr. Cube was acquitted of charges related to drug possession in 2006, he continued to fight the case in court. Last year, he won a landmark settlement in Los Angeles County Superior Court, agreeing to pay nearly $2.5 million in compensation to more than 100 victims. While most of those settlements involved claims related to sexual assault, others involved other crimes. “This is just another example of how important it is to stay true to who we are and stand behind our convictions,” said Mike D. Lewis, a producer who worked closely with Mr. Cube in the early 1990s and helped negotiate the payout. “It’s unfortunate that someone like Mr. Cube chooses to not be honest about who they really are.” Mr. Cube has always maintained that he is a musician. But he also says that he does not identify as African-American. “I am not African-American,” he said in a 2014 interview. “I am Caucasian, and I am mixed race.�” The label of African-American identity is often complicated, especially among musicians and celebrities. Some African-Americans embrace their identities as African-Americans, and vice versa. Others feel uncomfortable with using the term, claiming that it is offensive. For years, fans and journalists alike have questioned Mr.. Obama for his use of “superman” in a campaign ad. But now, after weeks of intense scrutiny over the ad’s portrayal of black people as violent criminals, some critics are questioning whether he has crossed the line into racial caricature. In an interview on Monday night, Mr. Obama said that while he was not offended by the ad’s message — which portrayed him as a humble man who would never resort to violence — he did not want to be associated with its content. “I don’t think I should be seen as the guy who does this kind of thing,” he said. “I think that’s inappropriate. It’s not what we stand for. We don’t condone that at all.” While the ad may have been intended to promote his candidacy, the president said, it had become too much of a distraction from the issues facing black Americans today. He added: “It’s hard enough to find jobs. You can’t just go out there and say, ‘Well, you know, I’m going to take your picture and send it around.’ That’s not how things work. And when you do something like that, you get called names. So it becomes a big deal. People get upset about it. They call me names.” A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee declined to comment on Mr. Obama’s comments or any other aspect of the controversy surrounding the ad. Ms. Clinton, in contrast, has consistently defended her husband’s record as one of the most successful presidents ever. She also pointed out that the ad did not mention President Barack Obama’s name in any way. “The ad does not imply endorsement,” she said. “We respect the fact that Mr. Obama is running for office and we hope that he will continue to run ads highlighting his accomplishments, but it is important to note that he has not endorsed us.” The ad itself was released last week, shortly before the release of the results of the presidential election. After being criticized for portraying blacks as violent criminals, Mr. Obama apologized on Sunday, saying that he regretted the ad was “disrespectful.” “I am deeply sorry if anyone was offended by my remarks,” he wrote on Twitter. “It was meant to highlight the successes of Black Lives Matter and others that have made our country safer and stronger.” At issue is not only the ad’s tone, but the context of its release. The ad was first aired during the final hours of the Republican primary season, as the candidates were making their closing arguments, and was quickly picked up by news outlets across the country. There was no indication that the ad would be used again, although many commentators noted that it was likely to be shown more widely. Some black leaders, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, called the ad racially charged, noting that it included images of young black men committing crimes and referred to them as supermen. On Tuesday, Mr. Booker said that the ad was a reflection of America’s history of slavery and segregation. “This is a very different era than we were in decades ago,” he told CNN. “There is a lot of anger here in this country about race relations, and it seems to come through very clearly in these kinds of commercials.” Even supporters of Mr. Obama conceded that they did not know why the ad was being circulated so broadly. One prominent critic, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, said that the ad was meant to draw attention away from the economic crisis gripping the nation. “I don’t see anything wrong with trying to raise awareness about poverty,” he said. “But you cannot do that by caricatures of poor black folks.” Still, he added, “I don’t think we need to be calling black people murderers.” Mr. Obama’s decision to apologize came just days after a new report revealed that he had accepted nearly $1 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, where he served as a top adviser. His spokesman, Michael R. Friedman, denied those allegations on Wednesday, saying that Mr. Obama had received no such payments."
"WASHINGTON — In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt. “Yesterday the Senate cast one of the most expensive votes in history,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said at the time. “Americans are wondering how we’re going to pay for all this.” Nine years later, during one of the longest economic expansions in American history, almost every Republican in Congress — including Mr. McConnell, now the majority leader — supports a tax plan that is projected to cause an even larger increase in the federal debt. Republicans got to that extraordinary point by a tangled path. First they argued that the tax cuts would stimulate the economy enough to pay for themselves, only to be confronted on Thursday with a report that said the cuts would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade. That bad news led to last-minute convulsions and a frantic search for more revenue. But in the end, the political imperative to pass what would be the only major piece of legislation of President Trump’s first year, along with a near-religious Republican belief in tax cuts, overrode their previous concerns about fiscal prudence. All but one Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted for the bill early Saturday. The House and the Senate still have to reach a final agreement on the details, and Mr. Trump has to sign his name, but the Republican Party now stands on the verge of driving up the national debt after spending much of the last decade promising rectitude and criticizing Democrats for profligacy. The legislation reads “as if it were developed for a country whose debt problems have been solved, when in reality debt is the highest it has ever been other than around World War II,” declared the co-chairmen of a bipartisan commission created in 2010 to propose measures for reducing the debt. Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, formerly President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, said the current crop of Republicans are avoiding “nearly all the hard choices.” Mr. McConnell has a well-documented history of fretting about the debt. “We’d like to do something about the nation’s biggest problem, spending and debt, which of course is the reason for this economic malaise,” he said in 2011. He added that Republicans could not address the problem because they did not control the White House or Senate. Last year, with Republicans in control of the House and the Senate and about to claim the White House, he reiterated his distaste for debt. “I think this level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,” Mr. McConnell said. “My preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral.” He continued in words that now seem particularly striking. “What I hope we will clearly avoid, and I’m confident we will, is a trillion-dollar stimulus,” he said. “Take you back to 2009. We borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything. So we need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly.” This week, the congressional scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, reported that the Senate’s tax plan is, in fact, a stimulus plan that costs $1 trillion — the amount it would add to the debt over the next decade after accounting for its significant economic benefits. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who shepherded the House’s version of the tax bill — which also would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade — has assiduously cultivated a reputation for concern about the federal debt. In 2011 he released “The Path to Prosperity,” a budget plan proposing large spending cuts to balance the books. He said fiscal discipline was unpopular but necessary. “What I do know is I can’t look my kids and my constituents in the eyes with my conscience being clear and not know that I didn’t do everything I could to try and fix this problem,” Mr. Ryan said in a 2011 interview with CNBC. In 2013, he said the debt “will weigh down our country like an anchor.” At the time, the federal debt held by investors equaled 72 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The Republican tax plan could push that to 85 percent by 2021, Goldman Sachs estimated Wednesday, which would be the highest debt ratio since the immediate aftermath of World War II. Republicans are gambling that voters would rather have tax cuts now and worry about debt later. That is certainly the position of the corporate sector, which has abandoned pious expressions of concern about Washington’s extravagance in favor of earnest pleas for tax relief. “Passing tax reform is the single most important thing that Congress can do to make American companies more competitive,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said last month. A number of prominent Republicans have defiantly insisted that economic forecasters are wrong about the likely cost of the tax cuts. They say the legislation will cause a surge of economic growth that will allow the government to collect just as much money at lower tax rates. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the analysis of the economists Congress employs for that purpose, using techniques he has endorsed, as “curious.” The Trump administration, without offering evidence, continues to insist the federal debt will not rise. Republicans also have long distinguished between deficits caused by spending increases and deficits caused by tax cuts. They argue that tax cuts are good for the economy, and that the resulting problem of larger deficits should be addressed by reducing government spending. “You also have to bring spending under control,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week. “And not discretionary spending. That isn’t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.” The tax cuts, however, would increase the scale of that challenge. Politicians of both parties also have lost their fear of debt in recent decades. The federal debt has grown much larger than was considered wise or even possible, with few apparent consequences. “Reagan proved that deficits don’t matter,” Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002. Many Republicans take the view that the George W. Bush administration’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 proved the same point. But federal borrowing imposes real economic costs, not least the need to make interest payments. It also restricts the funding available to private-sector investors. And experts continue to warn that the United States is on an unsustainable trajectory, particularly because the government has promised benefits to an expanding population of older Americans that will further outstrip tax revenue. “It’s the type of thing that should keep people awake at night,” Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, told a congressional committee last week. But in Washington, in 2017, such warnings are no longer in vogue.","WASHINGTON — In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt. “Yesterday the Senate cast one of the most expensive votes in history,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said at the time.","WASHINGTON — In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt. “Yesterday the Senate cast one of the most expensive votes in history,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said at the time.. The vote was 52 to 47 against. But then came the financial meltdown and the government shutdown that followed. Republicans were split on how to handle the spending bill, which passed by a narrow margin. Some wanted to keep the money flowing as quickly as possible while others argued for austerity measures or even repeal. After all, the Obama administration had promised to veto any legislation that did not include tax cuts and other changes needed to reduce deficits. So the debate over what should be done with the billions of dollars spent on the economy turned into something more like a political football game than a policy fight: Who is going to pay for this? What will happen if we don’t get our way? And who should pay for it? That question has been debated since before the recession hit. It has also become increasingly urgent after President Trump took office last year, when he vowed to cut taxes and free up capital for investment. As his first major legislative achievement, Mr. Trump signed into law a sweeping rewrite of the nation’s immigration laws. He promised to roll back regulations imposed during the previous decade and impose stiff fines on companies that do business in areas where there are no environmental protections. His new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has already taken aim at those rules. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump plans to sign another order barring foreign governments from cutting off American citizens’ access to health insurance markets. And he intends to make good on promises made by former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush to build infrastructure projects across America. Those moves have raised concerns about whether the United States can afford the costs of such programs without significant revenue increases from the private sector. The budget deficit is projected to grow to nearly $1 trillion next fiscal year, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. With interest payments on the national debt soaring, some economists worry that taxpayers may end up footing the bill for years of lost growth. “We need to start thinking about what are the priorities,” said David Cutler, the chief economist at Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. “Is it infrastructure, education, research, energy? Or is it jobs and wages?” A bipartisan group of senators recently asked Mr. Trump to consider revising the tax code so that corporations could deduct their overseas profits. They proposed doubling the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly and allowing people to write off unused medical expenses. Mr. Trump said he would look into the idea but declined to comment on specifics. “I am looking at everything, including the corporate rate,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this month. “I am looking at making sure that everybody pays their fair share. I want everybody to pay their fair share.” For now, Democrats say they are willing to accept less spending on defense and domestic programs in exchange for raising taxes on wealthy Americans and closing loopholes that allow them to avoid paying income taxes. But Democrats are still far apart on many issues, including how much to raise the estate tax, which currently applies only to inherited wealth. And they remain divided over whether to expand Social Security benefits, which cost roughly $2 trillion per year. While the party controls both houses of Congress, it does not control the White House, and its leaders cannot unilaterally change the country’s entitlement program. Party unity on these matters is critical to keeping the government open, which helps ensure that lawmakers can work together to pass bills. If they fail to reach agreement, however, the government might shut down again. Last week, Mr. Trump suggested that he might be willing to revisit the issue of entitlements. “If you believe that you’re entitled to certain things, then maybe you shouldn’t be receiving them,” Mr. Trump said in a speech to the National Rifle Association. “You shouldn’t be getting your check. You shouldn’t be getting your food stamps. You shouldn’t be getting your housing allowance. Why? Because it’s unfair.” Republicans are hoping to use their majority to force Democrats to take a stand on entitlement reform, either through the passage of a constitutional amendment requiring the expansion of Social Security benefits or an overhaul of the program itself. But many Democrats fear that such a move would alienate voters, especially African-Americans, whom they say they represent. And they are wary of being seen as soft on crime. But they concede that the best option is to wait until the current system is reformed before expanding Social Security benefits. That is why Mr. Trump appears eager to push ahead with entitlement reforms, despite having just signed an executive order restricting deportations of young immigrants brought illegally to the United States. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has called for increasing military spending and reducing regulation on oil and gas drilling. But he has yet to put forward any ideas about the future of Medicare and Medicaid. When pressed for details, he said the Affordable Care Act was “probably dead” because it would have left too many people uninsured. He also suggested that Social Security benefits should be cut back in favor of a new system of entitlement programs. And when asked about his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, Mr. Trump replied: “I don’t know how you do that. I mean, we can’t pay for it. We need a big wall. It’s not going to happen.” As president, Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to slash taxes and reduce regulations — but he has never offered specifics on how to achieve those goals. His campaign promises are often vague or aspirational, leaving Americans with little guidance as they try to navigate a political landscape where Washington is increasingly polarized over immigration policy. The most prominent example of this is Mr. Trump’s promise to build a wall between America and Mexico. While some Republicans support building walls across the country, others say such barriers are unnecessary and expensive. A number of Republican lawmakers have proposed replacing current laws requiring employers to provide health insurance to their workers with a single-payer government program. Such proposals, however, would require congressional approval and could face stiff opposition from Democrats who control both chambers of Congress. For now, there seems to be no consensus among Republicans about what form the nation’s immigration system should take. Some want a path to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants; others want them to apply only for work permits. Still others believe illegal immigration should be ended entirely. But even if a bipartisan solution were found, many Republicans still oppose such measures. They argue that such changes would increase economic inequality by encouraging more people to enter the labor force and lead to higher wages for American businesses and consumers. “We’re going to get rid of Obamacare,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told CNN last week. “But the biggest problem is the fact that our economy is based on a broken immigration system. That’s why we have so much unemployment, why we have so much poverty.” With Republicans controlling the House and Senate, the next step will be trying to pass legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law last year. But the bill must overcome fierce resistance from conservatives, including members of the Freedom Caucus, who fear that it would allow millions more Americans to remain uninsured. If passed, the replacement measure would probably include provisions similar to those included in the original Affordable Care Act, like expanding access to affordable contraception coverage and allowing states to opt out of certain requirements related to pre-existing medical conditions. Those changes might help stabilize premiums, although analysts warn that other aspects of the law, such as protections against discrimination and enforcement of existing federal rules, may pose greater obstacles to lowering costs. Mr. Trump himself has been open about his desire to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Speaking at a rally here on Thursday night, he promised to repeal the individual mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance, saying it had become “an embarrassment to us.” He also said he wanted to end subsidies paid by low-income families to buy private plans, calling it “a disgrace to taxpayers.” But since taking office, he has shown few signs of being ready to embrace a broader overhaul of the health care system. Instead, he has focused on repealing the Affordable Care Act and pushing through tax cuts aimed at helping corporations and wealthy individuals avoid paying billions of dollars in penalties. He has also pushed aggressively for tax reductions to fund infrastructure projects and to make college free. And he has sought to roll back parts of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law that helped create the modern financial industry. On Wednesday, he declared that the Federal Reserve needed to be abolished, saying that its actions were “the greatest threat to our economy in my lifetime.” “They’ve taken away your freedom,” Mr. Trump said. “You’re not allowed to go outside your borders. You’re not allowed to go buy things. You’re not allowed to leave your state. You’re not allowed to move. You’re not allowed to get married. You’re not allowed to be able to vote.” Asked about the prospect of legalizing the status of Dreamers, a group of immigrant youth whose legal status is protected by a Supreme Court decision, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that “we’ll see what happens” after the court issues its ruling."
"WASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton’s personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation. To track how the information flowed, agents will try to gain access to the email accounts of many State Department officials who worked there while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, the officials said. State Department employees apparently circulated the emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011, and some were ultimately forwarded to Mrs. Clinton. They were not marked as classified, the State Department has said, and it is unclear whether its employees knew the origin of the information. The F.B.I. is also trying to determine whether foreign powers, especially China or Russia, gained access to Mrs. Clinton’s private server, although at this point, any security breaches are speculation. Law enforcement officials have said that Mrs. Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president, is not a target of the investigation, and she has said there is no evidence that her account was hacked. There has also been no evidence that she broke the law, and many specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in her account was probably of marginal consequence. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said in a statement on Friday that she “took the handling of classified information very seriously.” “She always received classified materials in secure settings, either by phone, videoconference, on paper or in person,” said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. “If, however, some material unknowingly ended up somewhere on the State Department’s unclassified email system, we want to continue to be as helpful as possible in getting to the bottom of that.” He added: “Beyond that, we’ll let the State Department and other agencies speak to the specifics.” This week, the inspector general of the nation’s intelligence agencies, I. Charles McCullough III, informed members of Congress that Mrs. Clinton had “top secret” information, the highest classification of government intelligence, in her account. Some of that information, according to a memorandum the inspector general sent to the heads of the Senate and House intelligence and judiciary committees, may have come from a program called Talent Keyhole, which relies on satellite intercepts of conversations or imagery data. The program involves some of the most secure information in the intelligence agencies’ computer systems. Specifically, the inspector general told members of Congress that two emails should have been classified as top secret, with one of them designated “TOP SECRET//SI//TK/NOFORN.” Officials familiar with the nomenclature said that “SI” stood for “special intelligence,” usually indicating an intercepted communication, and that “TK” was routinely used as an abbreviation for Talent Keyhole, showing that the communication or an image was obtained from a satellite. Attached to the memo — which was publicly released by Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee — were copies of two of Mrs. Clinton’s emails that Mr. McCullough said contained classified information. Those emails were not released publicly. The State Department has questioned whether the determination by Mr. McCullough is correct. Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with the view of some federal officials that the State Department is not rigorous enough in handling classified national security information. In an unusual move, the F.B.I.’s inquiry is being led out of its headquarters in Washington, blocks from the White House. Nearly all investigations are assigned to one of the bureau’s 56 field offices. But given this inquiry’s importance, senior F.B.I. officials have opted to keep it closely held in Washington in the agency’s counterintelligence section, which investigates how national security secrets are handled. The investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails has its roots in her decision to use only a private email account for her official business when she was secretary of state, an unorthodox decision that gave her some control over what was made public. She faced criticism when her use of the account became known this year, and after deleting what she said were more than 31,000 personal emails, she turned over more than 30,000 work-related emails for the State Department to make public. Mrs. Clinton has said that her emails contained no classified information — having classified information outside a secure government account is illegal — and that she is fully cooperating with the investigation. But in reviewing a sampling of the emails for potential security breaches, Mr. McCullough said he found four out of 40 that contained classified information, though perhaps stripped of any indication that it was of classified origin. According to current and former State Department officials who worked with Mrs. Clinton, most classified information was routed to classified government servers in her office, where it was printed out for her review. Her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, often operated the same way. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Thursday in response to what she said were “allegations about Mrs. Clinton’s emails” that “none of the emails alleged to contain classified information were written by Secretary Clinton” and that “none of the emails alleged to contain classified information include any markings that indicate classified content.” In a letter made public on Wednesday, David Kendall, Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer, said he had handed over to the Justice Department a thumb drive containing the 30,000 emails that had been given to the State Department. He also said the company that had handled Mrs. Clinton’s personal account had given the Justice Department the server Mrs. Clinton used to operate it. The company, Platte River Networks, had been in possession of the server since 2013. Computer experts said it was likely that F.B.I. technicians would be able to recover from the server at least some of Mrs. Clinton’s deleted personal emails. In addition, specially trained cybersecurity investigators will seek to determine whether Russian, Chinese or other hackers breached the account or tried to transfer any of Mrs. Clinton’s emails, including those containing the classified information, several officials said. Mrs. Clinton’s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, told CBS News this week that “it is very likely” that Russian or Chinese hackers read his emails, although he did not specify whether he was talking about his classified or unclassified accounts. “I certainly write things with that awareness,” he said.","WASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton’s personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation.","WASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton’s personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation.. The inquiry is focused on whether Mr. Obama administration officials were complicit in providing material that was not publicly available about a covert operation by Secretary of State John Kerry. Investigators have been examining how an intelligence agency with access to top secret documents obtained the emails through a separate government program known as “electronic surveillance.” At issue is the use of those same records for the secretary of state’s personal email. If so, it would be a significant break from past practice: In recent years, most secretaries of state have used their own accounts for official correspondence, but the State Department has never had its own system for handling sensitive communications. That could pose problems if Mrs. Clinton or her aides were caught using a private account for work-related matters, like preparing speeches, meetings and other official business. It also raises questions about how much she knew about what was going on inside her network when she decided to set up the new arrangement last year. Her lawyers say they are reviewing the matter. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. But one official said that while there is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton herself authorized the use of her personal account for State Department business, it could still constitute a violation of department policy. Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. She has said she does not know why the State Department did not create a separate account for her. “It’s a serious problem,” said David M. Friedman, a former senior United States attorney for the Southern District of New York who is now an assistant professor at Columbia University School of Public Affairs. “If you don’t have your own system, then you can’t have your own security. And that’s where this becomes important, because it’s very easy to get into trouble.” In June 2014, the State Department released a report saying Mrs. Clinton’s staff had failed to properly safeguard some of the emails on her private account, which contained information related to the 2012 attack on Osama bin Laden. Some of the messages were marked “classified,” meaning that only a select group of people had access to them. Others were labeled “confidential” or “top secret” and were intended for internal use only. The State Department did not release the names of the individuals involved. The State Department and the Defense Department also did not make public the contents of the emails, even though many of the messages were marked “confidential.” Those markings were included in a list of categories called CLASSIFIED, CONFIDENTIAL or TOP SECRET, which were defined in the report. The report found that Mrs. Clinton and her aides had violated federal regulations governing the preservation of national defense secrets by failing to preserve some of the emails on her account. The rules required that all such materials be destroyed after 30 days, unless they were deemed necessary for an ongoing investigation. Mrs. Clinton has disputed that assertion. “The fact that I am being investigated for my email practices is completely false,” she told reporters at a news conference last month. “I am not under investigation. We are simply looking at whether I broke the rules.” An examination of the State Department’s electronic surveillance program, which collects data from phone calls, Internet traffic and social media posts, may shed light on the role played by the Obama administration officials who received classified information from the NSA. Officials familiar with the case said that the review of the State Department’s surveillance program began months ago, and that the government has already identified several dozen employees who had access to the material. The review was conducted by the Office of Intelligence Policy Review, led by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of National Intelligence. The review, which will be completed next week, is part of the broader effort to identify potential leakers within the executive branch. Mr. Clapper has said he believes that the leak occurred during the course of his oversight of the surveillance program. He has said that the Obama administration officials were aware of the leaks and should have acted to stop them. The review is likely to focus on the conduct of the two highest ranking members of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. They are both married to longtime associates of Mr. Obama, and they serve as deputy chief of staff to the president. Both women have served as aides to Mrs. Clinton since 2010. The review is expected to turn up additional information that might help investigators piece together what happened behind closed doors, including conversations between Ms. Abedin and the State Department. On Wednesday, Mrs. Abedin said she was not ready to discuss the case. “I’m going to wait until the end of the day to talk about it,” she said. The State Department has asked Congress for permission to declassify some of the emails, which were sent in 2013 and 2014. The State Department is also preparing a report on Benghazi that will be released publicly next week. But Ms. Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, has been reluctant to reveal her private correspondence with Mr. Obama because he had already made public his own history with Mrs. Clinton. In an interview last month, she refused to answer questions about her personal life, saying only: “I have no idea what you’re talking about. I don’t know if there are any other people involved in this.” She did say she would like to see more transparency around government investigations into the 2012 attacks on the United States diplomatic compound in Libya. Her spokesman, Nick Merrill, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said the senator would not discuss the Benghazi investigation. He also denied being told by Hillary Rodham Clinton’s staff that they could withhold information related to the attack from the House Oversight Committee investigating the matter. “The president does not want anyone to get hurt or embarrassed,” Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said at a news conference after meeting privately with Mrs. Clinton on Friday. “He doesn’t want anybody to be afraid of him.” The White House has declined requests for interviews, but officials said they expected to release their version of events as soon as Monday. On Sunday night, Mrs. Clinton held a fund-raiser for former President Bill Clinton, including a speech by one of his daughters. The event raised $1 million for charity. “I am grateful for all my friends who supported me through thick and thin,” she said. “It means so much to everyone who knew me personally and who I was close to — even when we disagreed, even when I thought it wasn’t fair, even when I didn’t think it was right. It meant everything.” Mr. Obama has repeatedly insisted that he never gave Mrs. Clinton permission to use a home telephone line to make calls to the State Department during her tenure. And he has maintained that she had no role in arranging the security for the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, who died in the attack. At least four Americans have come forward since then to describe how Mrs. Clinton, who served under both presidents, played a central role in helping secure the compound, according to two administration insiders. They described a series of meetings between Mrs. Clinton and senior aides, including Susan Rice, the national security adviser, and Sean Spicer, the press secretary, where she suggested ways to improve the security. One of those aides, Jason D. Richardson, now a top aide at the National Security Council, said in an email on Saturday that Mrs. Clinton had urged him to send messages to reporters asking them to withhold details about the episode, which occurred hours before Mr. Obama left office. “She wanted us to keep our story as simple as possible,” Mr. Richardson wrote. “We agreed and sent her the text of the message she wanted us to send.” Another official said the White House had received several complaints from members of Congress over the years about Mrs. Clinton’s handling of the Benghazi inquiry. That official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the subject. “To date, nobody has come forward to explain why Secretary Clinton chose to stay silent and allow the committee to pursue its work without having an explanation,” the official said. Mrs. Clinton has faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for her response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. She has said she believes the attacks were justified and that the U.S. should have done more to prevent them. She has also insisted that she acted alone. Mr. Obama has pointed out that he was briefed by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta about the attack, and that he met with Mrs. Clinton twice. “If she did anything wrong, it was entirely up to her,” Mr. Obama said in an interview last year. “The fact that she did something wrong is not a defense against it. If she did something wrong, she should take responsibility.” Mr. Obama has sought to distance himself from Mrs. Clinton and her husband, whom he called a “bad fit” for high office, and has defended the decision to leave the country’s embassy in Cairo after the attacks."
