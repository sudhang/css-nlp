"It was Donald J. Trump’s chance to sound contrite and mature, to explain away the sexually predatory boasts he was caught making on tape and to persuade Americans that — for all his no-apologies braggadocio — he was, in fact, capable of feeling shame. Maura Cotter, 22, a senior at the University of Notre Dame, was shocked at what Mr. Trump did instead in Sunday’s debate: repeat, over and over, that what he had said on the 2005 recording, about forcing himself on women and grabbing their genitals, was simply “locker-room banter.” It was, Ms. Cotter said, “not an apology — no reason to believe he’s changed at all.” A classmate, Abigail Wilson, who is a registered Republican, listened closely to Mr. Trump and was reminded, she said, of the time she was groped by a stranger. The Republican nominee, she said soberly, “may not have physically harmed anyone with his words, but he has the power to do so by example.” Whether they love Mr. Trump or loathe him, many female voters interviewed across the country seemed to watch Sunday’s historically nasty debate through the same inescapable prism: a raunchy three-minute recording in which Mr. Trump told of kissing and touching women however he pleased. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” he said, loud and clear, on the tape. That is Mr. Trump’s new, agonizing and self-created reality: He may have uttered words about unfair trade deals or threats to national security, but what these voters heard instead was his voice on that searing recording, casually and excitedly explaining that he could sexually assault strangers with impunity. Some said they were so upset by what they had seen — over and over — that they could barely bring themselves to turn on the television and watch him in the debate. Others dismissed the tape as entirely beside the point, a decade-old distraction with no bearing on the presidency. “We’re all human,” said Gayle Mason, 73, a retired kindergarten teacher and a Republican in West Covina, Calif., who watched the debate on Fox News over iced tea. “When he becomes president, you’re not going to see stuff like that.” But on this, the voters interviewed all agreed: The sound of Mr. Trump at his most obscene lingered over Sunday night’s confrontation like an unbudging cloud. Several voters tuned in for the sole purpose of watching Mr. Trump explain his lasciviousness aboard the “Access Hollywood” bus. Joey Elliott, 63, who lives in South Bend, Ind., said she wanted “to see how he tries to squirm out of it.” From the debate’s opening moments, Mrs. Clinton grabbed hold of the recording and turned it into a rhetorical battering ram. In a measured but firm tone, she seized on Mr. Trump’s claim that the tape did not really represent who he was. “I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it,” she said. “It represents exactly who he is.” It was a striking and singular tableau: a male candidate for president being asked, by the first woman to share such a stage, to defend crude comments in which he had seemed to reduce her gender to its anatomy. Despite his best efforts, Mr. Trump could not quickly put the issue to rest. A moderator, Anderson Cooper, pressed him about the tape four times, wondering if Mr. Trump understood the gravity of what he had said, and whether he had ever carried out the lewd actions he had described. No, Mr. Trump said. Eventually, the debate moved on. After saying he was sorry but doing little to demonstrate remorse, Mr. Trump instead sought to turn the ugliest phase of his campaign into an attack on Bill Clinton’s past sexual trespasses — by turning Mrs. Clinton into a wife who had abided, aided and abetted her husband’s misdeeds. “There’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women,” Mr. Trump said, minimizing his behavior as language, not actions. “Don’t tell me about words.” Rarely has gender played such a significant role in a presidential debate. The candidates on the general-election stage, until now, were always men, and discussion of the sexes tended to be perfunctory. But Sunday night was different. Sex was a cudgel, a motif, a backdrop. It was never out of the picture. And the dynamics between the man and the woman onstage played out in powerful and unexpected ways. At one point, Mrs. Clinton deferred to Mr. Trump on a question about the future of President Obama’s signature health legislation, the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump tried a moment of male chivalry. “No, I’m a gentleman, Hillary,” Mr. Trump said, with a dramatic sweep of his arm. “Go ahead.” And with each response, Mrs. Clinton stepped toward voters in the audience, paying little mind to Mr. Trump’s personal space, as if seeking to rattle Mr. Trump merely by being a woman unbound, free to roam where she pleased, as a nation watched. In nearly two dozen interviews conducted in person and by telephone during the debate, women expressed deep reservations about Mr. Trump’s demeanor, interruptions and, above all, the dismissive manner with which he brushed aside the recording in which he casually bragged about assaulting women. Diane Crawford, 62, a resident of Greenfield, Iowa, was struck by how eagerly Mr. Trump sought to change the subject to Mrs. Clinton’s spouse and his infidelities. “He just kept throwing Bill Clinton in there,” she said, “and Bill Clinton is not running for president.” A skeptic of Mrs. Clinton’s heading into the debate, Ms. Crawford said she had changed her mind during those tense exchanges. “I’m not hesitant any longer to support Hillary,” Ms. Crawford said. “She showed her leadership ability with her response.” Karyn Sloas, 48, an independent in Knoxville, Tenn., said she had planned to vote for Mr. Trump until she heard about the recording on social media over the weekend. She was repulsed. She thought of the example that Mr. Trump had set for her 16-year-old daughter and her 18-year-old son. “I don’t want him to think it’s O.K. to talk that way,” Ms. Sloas said. The tape was a breaking point for Donna Stevens, too. An independent in suburban Valley Cottage, N.Y., she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Trump. Then she watched the recording. “What he said was appalling,” she said. For Mr. Trump, Sunday night’s early focus on the 2005 tape was the culmination of a remarkable series of provocations against women. His first appearance in a primary debate, in August 2015, had led to a highly public — and deeply sexualized — attack against a woman, Megyn Kelly, when he suggested that Ms. Kelly, a Fox News anchor who was among the moderators, had been menstruating when she asked him tough questions. He went on to mock the appearance of a female rival, Carly Fiorina. And he accused Mrs. Clinton of playing “the woman card” in her primary, suggesting that she expected to prevail simply because of her sex. Now, in the final weeks of the campaign, it is Mr. Trump whose campaign is imperiled by his careless approach to gender. On Sunday, Ms. Sloas in Knoxville waited for Mr. Trump to redeem himself in her eyes, by displaying real regret for his treatment of women on the recording. “He’d have to show true remorse,” she said. “We, and I mean ‘we,’ as in America, would have to see remorse.” All night, she said, he failed to demonstrate it. “I wanted to hear ‘I was wrong,’” Ms. Sloas said, minutes after the debate had concluded. “I didn’t get that.”","It was Donald J.

She said Mr. Trump’s comments were not only offensive but also dangerous. “I think it sends a message to men who are thinking about doing this kind of thing,” Ms. Wilson said. “If they can get off with just saying it was locker room talk, then maybe it’s O.K. to do.” The reaction among many young voters like Ms. Cotter, who have been energized by Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and who see themselves as part of the future, was swift and visceral, with some saying they would never vote for him, even if she could be persuaded that he might change. But Mr. Trump has always seemed impervious to such criticism, even when his own party leaders and allies were calling for a more disciplined campaign after a series of missteps and controversies in recent weeks. In the past week alone, Mr. Trump has called Senator John McCain and Representative Joe Heck liars and suggested that Mrs. Obama has ties to Islamic terrorism. He has repeatedly attacked Judge Gonzalo P?rez de Cuellar, the former United Nations ambassador who oversaw peace talks between Israel and Palestine, for being biased against Israel and accused President Barack Obama of trying to start World War III. And in an interview last week with Fox News Channel, he described Mr. Obama as having done nothing during his eight years as president except make things worse in America. “He’s made it much, much worse than I thought possible,” he told Sean Hannity. Mr. Trump has long been known as someone willing to say whatever comes into his head, but in the wake of the release of the video on Friday showing him bragging to Billy Bush about how easily he kisses beautiful women because he’s famous and grabs them by their pussies without asking for consent, he had promised that he was going to try harder, be less impulsive, and show greater discipline. Instead, in his first presidential debate since those remarks became public knowledge, he repeated his comments almost verbatim — and then added more. When asked directly whether he believed sexual assault allegations made against him, Mr. Trump responded, “Of course, you know what happens, right?” And later on Sunday night, when Mr. Hannity pressed him again to apologize for the tape — which he refused to do — Mr. Trump replied, “No.” Instead, he turned the question back to his opponent: What about Bill Clinton, the husband of Mrs. Clinton? “Bill and me we have great respect for each other. We disagree very strongly on politics,” Mr. Trump replied. Mr. Hannity tried to press Mr. Trump further, suggesting that his words in the tape showed the candidate was “unfit” to lead. Mr. Trump replied that it was a private conversation and that the media should stop talking about it. “You don’t want to hear anymore, please stop!” Mr. Trump shouted, before turning the microphone to the audience, where someone yelled out, “We love Donald! We love Donald!” The crowd cheered loudly. Mr. Trump smiled broadly. “That makes my life so easy.” In an appearance on ABC on Monday morning, he again insisted that “this stuff happened ten or fifteen years ago.” The next day, in another television interview, he said the same. But in a statement released late Saturday night, after the second round of debates had ended and before the third one began on Tuesday night, his team offered an explanation of sorts for why he has remained unrepentant in spite of his own advisers urging him to try to move beyond this issue. “The statements attributed to Mr. Trump nearly two decades ago reflect crude language by people seeking entertainment value and political advantage. They certainly represent my views today – absolutely nothing changes,” read a portion of the statement, written by Michael Cohen, who serves as both his lawyer and spokesman. The rest of the statement, however, did little to explain why the man running to become commander in chief would continue to defend himself with such language, or to offer any apology. It went on to accuse Mr. Clinton of “attacking our nation” with “her failed policies that destroyed jobs” and said that “the American worker is tired of losing ground and wants the government on the side of working families, not big donors and special interests.” In fact, Mr. Trump is trailing badly in polls and fundraising, while Mrs. Clinton continues to widen her margin over the Republican nominee as she tries to lock up delegates ahead of next month’s convention. But Mr. Trump, whose supporters believe the polls to be rigged, has continued to insist that he will win, and that the election may well come down to his ability to persuade enough Americans to support him. On Monday morning, at a rally in North Carolina, he continued to attack his opponent, saying that “she doesn’t have what it takes to make America great again,” but also saying, without elaboration, that “I am going to do something about this country that nobody else can possibly do.” He then turned to the subject of Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump, who had previously praised Mr. Obama for being born in Hawaii, has repeatedly questioned whether Mr. Obama was actually an eligible candidate for president because, according to some theories, he was actually born abroad. At one point during his speech, Mr. Trump even suggested that the former first lady might be involved. He said: “You know where Barack Hussein came from? You don’t know that yet. Where does he really come from?” When the crowd began chanting, “Kenya! Kenya!” he added, “We should look into Obama very carefully and we’ll find out exactly how you like it,” before adding: “Maybe there’s nothing wrong, maybe everything is fine.” He later told reporters that “there are people talking right now who say they think there’s a problem with President Obama” and that he wanted “to get an answer to that question, because I want everybody else to feel good and comfortable about it, too.” Asked if that meant he believed Mr. Obama was foreign-born, he replied: “That could happen.” But when pressed further on why he thought that, he offered no explanation, other than to repeat his belief that the president is hiding information about his background. “There are many reasons, there are so many,” Mr. Trump said, “but the main reason is we just want to be sure he’s qualified for office.” A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment, saying only that the campaign stands by its previous statements. on the issue. The remarks were not new; they echo what he had been saying on Twitter and at rallies since last year, and are part of a broader effort to cast doubt on President Barack Obama’s citizenship status and legitimacy as commander in chief. “The fact of the matter is, if he were running against anybody else, they would bring up these issues,” said Donald J. McGahn II, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. McGahn said that while it was important to address questions raised by the birther movement and others, “we need to move beyond them and talk about policy.” Asked what those policies should include, Mr. Trump did not offer specifics but said that he would focus on jobs, trade deals and immigration, among other things. The Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from his comments in recent days, after some Republicans criticized him. On Tuesday, it released a statement reiterating that he believes President Obama was born in Hawaii and saying, “He will continue to work hard every day as your next President to Make American Great Again.” Mr. Trump’s speech was billed as an economic plan for working Americans. It focused heavily on job creation, tax cuts, infrastructure spending and renegotiating international agreements. “If we’re smart and tough enough to win a war and keep our children safe, then surely we are smart enough to rebuild our roads and bridges,” he said. But much of his time onstage was spent attacking Hillary Clinton, whom he called “Crooked HIllary” and the worst possible choice for voters. “She wants a massive increase in illegal immigrants coming into our country. She wants open borders, she wants sanctuary cities and catch-and-release programs. And you know what? We want secure borders and a deportation force. That is all part of my program,” he said. The audience cheered wildly. “And she has absolutely zero respect for law enforcement officers.” The campaign was hoping the event would mark a turning point in the race, a moment that could help turn around Mr. Trump’s fortunes and propel him toward victory over Ms. Clinton. Instead, Mr. Trump appeared to fall back on familiar themes of anger, resentment and fear. His supporters seemed energized, but the reaction was far more muted than when he spoke last week in Phoenix. In his introduction, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called Mr. Trump a man who “has never forgotten the lessons of life on Main Street, USA,” but Mr. Trump himself spent most of his hourlong appearance on stage attacking Mrs. Clinton, who was nowhere in sight. “Hillary is crooked. Crooked Hillary. She’s got problems, big ones. Big, really bad. Really. They don’t call her crooked, though. No they don’t. Crooked Hillary. Crooked Hillary is what they call her. Not nice stuff. Crooked Hillary. And by the way, crooked isn’t strong enough. She’s corrupt."
"WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger slipped into the State Department last week for a quiet lunch in his old office with Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chief executive, who has all but covered himself in a cloak of invisibility in his first six weeks as secretary of state. Describing his impressions, Mr. Kissinger, perhaps America’s most famous diplomatic strategist, chose his words judiciously. “The normal tendency when you come into that job is to increase your visibility and to show that you are present and in charge,” he said in an interview. “He wanted to first inform himself of all the nuances. I was impressed by the confidence and self-assurance that he showed.” But in the Washington of Donald J. Trump, where foreign policy proclamations often appear first on Twitter, and where White House advisers are still battling for dominance, this approach can be seen as brilliant, mystifying or a prescription for powerlessness. Mr. Tillerson has skipped every opportunity to define his views or give guidance to American diplomats abroad, limiting himself to terse, scripted statements, taking no questions from reporters and offering no public protest when the White House proposed cutting the State Department budget by 37 percent without first consulting him. He suffered in silence, State Department officials said, when President Trump called, in a matter-of-fact way, to reject Mr. Tillerson’s choice for deputy secretary of state. He has been absent from the White House meetings with key world leaders, and when the State Department issued its annual report on human rights — usually a major moment for the United States to stand up against repression around the world — he skipped the announcement. Defenders say Mr. Tillerson has been accomplishing far more behind the scenes, including arranging for the first trip of a Saudi foreign minister to Iraq in more than a quarter-century — his first foray into the sinkhole of Middle East politics. “He’s already developing plans to begin ratcheting back Putin’s nefarious behavior,” Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview — steps that would represent the first known effort by the new administration to face off against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “He’s won status and respect of the president, of McMaster, and talks all the time to Jared,” the senator said, referring to the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who has emerged as a prominent voice on American foreign policy. “He doesn’t mind at all that these stories are being written about him being missing,” Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said about Mr. Tillerson. “When he’s ready to talk, you will be very highly impressed.” On Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson will leave for his first truly fraught diplomatic mission: a trip to Japan, South Korea and China, at a moment when open conflict with North Korea is a growing possibility, and when the administration is planning Mr. Trump’s first meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. The trip is so vital that the “principals” committee of the National Security Council is set to convene on Monday to discuss the North Korean threat and how to deal with China, so that Mr. Tillerson speaks from a consensus strategy. But do not expect to hear much about that strategy from the secretary before he arrives in Asia: The State Department has told reporters that they cannot ride on the plane. The decision appears to be unprecedented for a major diplomatic trip — even four decades ago, when Mr. Kissinger was conducting shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East and opening up China, he was delivering spin to reporters on the plane and offering up diplomatic tutorials. “All his predecessors have traveled with press,” said R. Nicholas Burns, who served as spokesman, ambassador and under secretary of state in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Failing to do so, he noted, creates the risk that the secretary of state will be defined by the country he is visiting — especially a place like China. Within the State Department, Mr. Tillerson, 64, got off to a promising start with a warm, humble greeting to staff members in the drab headquarters’ flag-draped foyer on his first day on the job. He talked about his upbringing and his wife’s belief that he had been preparing for this job his whole life, even if he had not known it. But few have heard from him since. Those who have say they regard him as an impressive manager who knows how to run a crisp meeting, take in a variety of views and give little away about his own. “He forces everyone to boil their memos down to a page or two, so they really have to think about what their message is,” said one official who has dealt with him frequently in recent weeks. “He’s already met with two of the most important Chinese officials. He knows a lot about some countries many secretaries don’t know about,” including Indonesia and others that have energy assets. He understands what embassies do, because Exxon Mobil often relied on them for help. But he is also introverted, a bit standoffish. He never met in person with John Kerry, his predecessor. “These guys came in to drain the swamp,” one career State Department official said, “and it’s clear that they are under orders not to cooperate or deal with swamp creatures.” So, for thousands in the State Department, Mr. Tillerson has come to be viewed as the phantom of Foggy Bottom, scarcely glimpsed and known mostly for his directives to wipe out some of the department’s top jobs. Longtime career officials who expected to stay in their jobs or remain long enough to show their successors the ropes were ousted in Mr. Tillerson’s first two weeks. He is talking to members of Congress about further cuts, and while there are plenty of opportunities in a department that has not exactly embraced technological change, the major reductions proposed by the administration are a nonstarter with many lawmakers. The biggest concern among diplomats and many in Congress is that when Mr. Trump talks about bolstering America’s commitment to its national security, he does not have diplomacy in mind. Longtime diplomats often cite — or email to reporters — a line uttered four years ago by the new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, when he was in charge of Central Command. “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition,” Mr. Mattis said at the time. As one diplomat who has met frequently with Mr. Tillerson since he took office noted recently, “Rex clearly agrees with that. He just won’t say it.” (A senior State Department official said Mr. Tillerson did say it, to Mr. Trump, over dinner a little more than a week ago.) On his first trip, to Europe, Mr. Tillerson went out of his way to reassure allies of the United States’ commitment to NATO, doing little to repeat the “America First” notion that Mr. Trump has promoted. In Asia, Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to visit the Demilitarized Zone on the border with North Korea, and it seems almost unimaginable that he would repeat Mr. Trump’s warning as a candidate that the United States may pull back from the region. So why is the man many in the State Department call T. Rex so quiet? Secretaries of state from both parties have relished their role as chief spokesman for American values. Madeleine K. Albright made her name describing the United States as the “indispensable nation” that needed to intervene in the Balkans. Colin L. Powell took the lead in making the case for invading Iraq (words he later regretted). Hillary Clinton, under President Barack Obama, highlighted human and women’s rights in particular. Mr. Kerry narrated his own role as relentless negotiator, sometimes using background briefings to read aloud from copious handwritten notes he had taken while haggling over the Iran nuclear deal and the removal of chemical weapons from Syria. In indiscreet moments, he talked about his differences of view, mostly on Syria, with Mr. Obama. There are several theories about Mr. Tillerson’s reticence. One is that his silence is highly strategic: He wants to cement key relationships in private, make sure he is aligned with a mercurial president and let the policy process at the National Security Council play out before making any grand pronouncements. The second is that he is waiting for the battles at the White House to burn out. In short, he wants to sidestep Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist, who believes that China’s rise can be halted and that Iran should be vigorously confronted, and work with Mr. Mattis, Mr. Kushner and Mr. McMaster. Mr. Corker said that “he’s already reached an agreement with Mattis to come to agreement and present ideas together,” something that Condoleezza Rice and Mrs. Clinton often did with their defense counterpart, Robert M. Gates. The third is that he sees the job as more akin to what he did at Exxon Mobil: Cut your deals, say as little as possible and take the heat. One of the first tests may come in the arena of human rights, where he caused alarm during his confirmation hearings in January by declining to criticize the killings ordered by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, in an antidrug campaign. Speaking out against repression has always been fraught; Mr. Kerry often danced around the topic when visiting Egypt. But Mr. Tillerson took up the issue on a recent call with Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, who was pressing him to link arms sales to Bahrain — home of the Fifth Fleet of the United States Navy — to measurable human rights improvements. “When we get the notifications of arms sales, it will be interesting to see if he has something to say on the issues we talked about,” Mr. Cardin said in an interview. He attributed some of Mr. Tillerson’s problems to the fact that “he doesn’t have his team in place.” “Having a subcabinet to back up your views,” Mr. Cardin added, “gives you the confidence to be more direct.” Clearly, Mr. Tillerson will not have much of a staff for a while; not a single under secretary or assistant secretary — the people who make the policy wheels turn — has been nominated, and only a couple of ambassadors have been named. Some say the problem is not with Mr. Tillerson, but those he works for. “Rex Tillerson is off to a slow start, but the White House is partly to blame,” said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, whom the administration briefly considered for a top post. “The president needs to give the secretary the staff he wants; protect, not decimate, his budget; and make clear to the world that it is the secretary and no one else who speaks for the administration when it comes to foreign policy.” Mr. Kissinger, at 93, is philosophical about most things, including Mr. Tillerson. “I would expect that as foreign policy evolves, Rex Tillerson will become an increasingly prominent exponent of it,” he said. “When I first came to Washington” as national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, “you would find me mentioned in The New York Times maybe 10 times.” A computer index suggests that the actual number in his first year was around 228, but who’s counting? Mr. Tillerson, in a sign of progress, has already exceeded that figure this year.","WASHINGTON — Henry A.

Describing his impressions, Mr. Kissinger, perhaps America’s most famous diplomatic strategist, chose his words judiciously. : “He is very much like he was at Exxon.” The two men are not friends; they have never met before. But they share an interest in international business and diplomacy. And they both know that their reputations will be closely scrutinized by President Trump’s critics. So it was no surprise when their meeting became public on Friday after the White House released photos from inside the department showing them together at a table in an otherwise empty room. It was also not surprising when the president later tweeted about the encounter: “Henry & I had a great discussion today. He knows more than anyone else alive on trade!” Mr. Tillerson’s meeting with Mr. Kissinger was part of what one senior administration official called an effort to show Mr. Tillerson in action. After spending much of last week holed up behind closed doors with aides, the new secretary began making appearances this week. On Monday, Mr. Tillerson held meetings with Secretary General Antonio Guterres of the United Nations; the foreign ministers of Japan, South Korea, India and Australia; the prime minister of New Zealand; and the president of Chad. On Tuesday, he traveled to Capitol Hill, where he spoke with senators of different parties and held private sessions with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, he was scheduled to meet with Secretary John F. Kerry, the departing Obama-era secretary of state. Mr. Tillerson also plans a trip next month to Mexico City, Washington, Brussels and London, according to people familiar with those discussions, and has been reaching out to other world leaders. In addition, he has begun reaching out to members of Congress to explain the rationale for some policy decisions the State Department made under Mrs. Clinton, including her decision in December to designate Iran a terrorist nation. He is expected to testify on Thursday before a Senate committee considering whether to confirm him, a hearing that could provide another opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to question Mr. Tillerson on issues ranging from human rights to climate change to Russia and China to North Korea. “The president wants to see him confirmed,” said Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of Mr. Trump’s harshest early detractors, who added, “I think there’s going to be a lot of questions asked, and we need answers.” “I want to make sure we get a full understanding of what happened at State and why,” said Representative Ed Royce of California, chairman of the foreign affairs panel. “We want to hear how he intends to fix the problems. We have a long way to go before we can say we have confidence in him.” But it will take time. In recent days, Mr. Tillerson’s advisers have sought to tamp down expectations that the former oil man would quickly turn around the troubled agency. They acknowledge the challenges facing him are immense. The State Department has lost thousands of employees since he left the company, many because of low morale. Many diplomats have grown frustrated with Mrs. Clinton, whose tenure ended amid controversy over how she handled classified information through a personal email account and server while serving at Foggy Bottom. Mr. Tillerson must rebuild relationships that were strained during Mrs. Clinton’s four years in charge. At the same time, he has promised Congress a major reorganization to streamline operations. Mr. Corker acknowledged that “there’s a learning curve” on the job and “it takes time to learn a bureaucracy like that.” But he warned against giving the secretary too much leeway: “If you don’t do your homework, you will fail. If he doesn’t do his homework, he’ll fail.” “There is no room for error,” he said, adding: “It is not a forgiving environment.” “This isn’t Exxon anymore. This isn’t business as usual,” Mr. Corker added, noting the secretary “has got to understand that, or we’re going to be disappointed.” In fact, it may be months before Mr. Tillerson begins to feel comfortable running the sprawling organization. “You don’t walk into an airplane cockpit and start flying right away,” Mr. Corker said, comparing it to a plane crash that killed three Americans. Mr. Corker has already suggested that Mr. Tillerson should begin to address his concerns over his qualifications for the post by hiring experienced career officials, rather than relying on political appointees, as the previous secretaries did. The senator also warned Mr. Tillerson that “he needs to learn quickly how to deal with this town.” “There is going to be a big difference between dealing with Congress on issues like sanctions on Iran and North Korea, which he dealt with all day every day for eight years,” he added. “And dealing with a congressman on an issue he disagrees with. That’s a whole other ball game.” Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said on Thursday that the Trump administration had not yet briefed him about its plans on Syria. He said Mr. Tillerson was scheduled to meet with senators next week but would have to answer questions first. “I think we need more information from them before they start briefing us,” he added. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has been critical of President Obama and Hillary Clinton over their handling of Libya, said the president should consider sending ground troops into the country if necessary. But Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of the most hawkish Republicans in Washington, was skeptical about military action, saying it could lead to another Iraq or Afghanistan, where American forces were bogged down with little progress. “We are talking about putting boots on the ground. We did that for decades,” Mr. McCain told reporters on Wednesday. “It didn’t work out very well.” The White House on Tuesday announced that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey agreed during talks last month in Ankara that Syrian rebels must withdraw their fighters to Idlib province by Feb. 11 or face being targeted. Mr. Erdogan and his Russian counterpart, Sergei L. Lavrov, met again this month in Sochi, Russia, to discuss implementation. On Thursday, Turkey said Mr. Assad must leave power as part of any solution to end Syria’s civil war. A spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, told CNN Turk television: “The only way forward in terms of a political transition in Syria is through negotiations that will bring the departure of Bashar al-Assad.” He added that Turkey’s priority was the protection of civilians, adding, “If there are no guarantees of the safety and security of people in these areas, then we cannot talk of anything else.” A senior State Department official on Friday declined to comment directly on whether the United States planned to arm anti-government groups inside Syria, saying that such decisions are made at higher levels. The official acknowledged that the administration’s policy toward Syria had changed since the election. The shift came after President Barack Obama made clear to President Trump that his predecessor had left office without having taken decisive steps against Syria for using chemical weapons and killing hundreds of Syrians. Mr. Obama ordered air strikes in April 2016 in response to what his aides described as his red line — use of banned chemicals by the government of the late dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Trump was reluctant to follow suit, according to former officials and others close to him. In early May 2017, the Pentagon presented to the new commander in chief options for punishing Syria. One proposal called for launching cruise missiles against three targets — including two research facilities — near Damascus and Homs, both strongholds of Syrian intelligence services. Another suggested bombing sites used to produce chlorine gas, sarin nerve agent and mustard gas. The third option involved striking chemical weapon storage depots. None of those proposals led to further discussion or planning for air attacks. Instead, in August, President Trump authorized air attacks on Shayrat Air Base, east of Latakia, where Syria stored some of its Scud missile launchers and aircraft. He followed up by ordering missiles fired into Deir el Zour Province, the center of Mr. Assad’s oil industry. A few days later, the United States launched Tomahawk land-based cruise missile strikes from ships off the coast of Yemen against Al Qaeda militants based in Sana. It is unclear whether any new decisions are under consideration. Aides say that the Syria debate continues within the West Wing and among outside advisers, but that Mr. Trump remains focused on domestic matters. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about intervening militarily in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East."
"Gov. Mike Pence, aligning himself with the Republican establishment rather than his running mate, broke with Donald J. Trump on Wednesday by endorsing Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s re-election bid, a day after Mr. Trump roiled the party by declaring that he was not yet ready to support the speaker. “I strongly endorse his re-election,” Mr. Pence, of Indiana, said in an interview with Fox News. “He’s a longtime friend, he’s a strong conservative leader.” The split between the two members of the Republican ticket over whether to endorse the speaker of the House in his own primary illustrated the party’s glaring divisions. Republican officials are nearing a state of panic as Mr. Trump’s near-daily provocations divert attention from the perceived vulnerabilities of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. “If he makes himself the issue, we’re going to lose,” said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member from Mississippi and a top lieutenant to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. “There’s only one guy who can fix this, and that’s Donald Trump. I hope he’s willing.” While running mates have differed on policy issues in the past, it is unheard-of for them to part ways on such traditionally uncontroversial matters as whether to support the re-election campaigns of other party leaders. But Mr. Trump, as he has demonstrated time and again, has little regard for the conventions of politics. And he is plainly angry that Mr. Ryan continues to criticize him for his inflammatory remarks. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said “I’m just not quite there yet” when asked in an interview with The Washington Post if he was supporting Mr. Ryan’s re-election. Mr. Trump’s choice of words sounded familiar: In May, Mr. Ryan said he was “not ready” to endorse Mr. Trump for president (the speaker subsequently did.) In a phone conversation between Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump on Wednesday morning, according to someone with knowledge of the call, Mr. Trump brought up his Washington Post interview. Mr. Pence, who served in the House with Mr. Ryan, said that while he understood where Mr. Trump was coming from, he personally was inclined to support Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump agreed that he should. But it was not just Mr. Trump’s rebuff of Mr. Ryan that was causing difficulties for Mr. Pence: The Republican vice-presidential nominee also happened to be meeting in Arizona on Tuesday night with Senator John McCain, just hours after Mr. Trump said in the same Washington Post interview that he also was not ready to endorse Mr. McCain’s campaign. Mr. McCain was cordial but direct with Mr. Pence, according to a Republican briefed on the meeting, making clear that he hoped the Indiana governor could help rein in Mr. Trump. Yet it was Mr. Trump’s slight of Mr. Ryan that was most exasperating to party officials. The speaker is facing a primary challenge in Wisconsin on Tuesday from a businessman, Paul Nehlen, who is running on a populist platform similar to Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Nehlen came to Mr. Trump’s defense this week after Mr. Ryan implicitly criticized the Republican nominee for ridiculing the Muslim parents of an American soldier, Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq. That prompted Mr. Trump to thank Mr. Nehlen on Twitter. And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told the Washington Post that Mr. Nehlen was “running a very good campaign.” This flirtation with Mr. Ryan’s challenger has infuriated Wisconsin’s leading Republicans. Gov. Scott Walker, who ran for president himself, and Senator Ron Johnson indicated that they would not join Mr. Trump for a scheduled appearance in Green Bay this week. And Mr. Walker on Wednesday posted a photograph of himself with Mr. Ryan on Twitter, saying,“We stand with Paul Ryan!” Mr. Walker did not respond to a question about Mr. Trump but said in an email that “Paul Ryan will win because he is totally in touch with his district.” Mr. Priebus, a Wisconsin native, is also said to be livid over Mr. Trump’s remarks about Mr. Ryan and debating the best way to demonstrate his solidarity with Mr. Ryan, from a formal endorsement to an email publicly stating his support, said three people with knowledge of Mr. Priebus’s internal discussions. Mr. Priebus has not had a direct conversation with Mr. Trump over the Ryan matter, according to people close to him. But he has been in contact with some of Mr. Trump’s children. Since endorsing Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan has continued to distance himself from the Republican nominee on several matters, from Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering the country to his comments criticizing Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Captain Khan’s parents. Mr. Priebus has made a point of staying neutral in all aspects of Republican primaries, including when asked to speak out against Mr. Trump. Deciding to publicly back Mr. Ryan in his primary would be a step away from that. For Mr. Priebus, Mr. Trump’s comments about Mr. Ryan were just the latest indignity in a week full of them. Earlier, Mr. Trump had criticized the Khan family for their speech at the Democratic National Convention and implied that Ms. Khan had not spoken because of her religion. Ms. Khan said she did not speak because she was worried she would be overcome with grief. Mr. Trump’s missteps in the weeks since the Republican convention have spurred a degree of open criticism among otherwise supportive party officials rarely seen since he secured enough delegates for the nomination in May. On Wednesday, two Republican congressman who had expressed misgivings about Mr. Trump, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, said they would not endorse him. The day before, another Republican congressman, Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Mrs. Clinton. In the Senate, Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, has been outspoken in opposing Mr. Trump. Party officials are hamstrung — there is no mechanism for removing Mr. Trump as the party’s candidate; he would have to step down himself. Nonetheless, party leaders are said to be furious at the controversies involving him. There are now active discussions among high-ranking Republican officials about how much longer the party can wait before recasting their focus away from Mr. Trump and toward down-ballot candidates. One adviser to Mr. Priebus indicated that, much as the party did when Bob Dole’s presidential campaign was flagging in 1996, officials may have to turn their attention to congressional and governors’ races as early as next month. Some Republican strategists, however, have little sympathy for the party committee, noting that it smoothed the way for Mr. Trump’s nomination by aggressively putting down efforts to let delegates vote their conscience. And, many in the party note, Mr. Priebus can hardly act surprised now about Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior, given his string of inflammatory comments since entering the race. “You would have to have had your eyes wide shut for the last year to think he would act differently in the general than he did in the primary,” said Josh Holmes, a top adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. At a campaign event in Daytona Beach, Fla., on Wednesday, Mr. Trump seized on national security and terrorism to lash into Mrs. Clinton, suggesting that if he had been president, the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks would not have happened.","Gov.

Mike Pence, aligning himself with the Republican establishment rather than his running mate, broke with Donald J. Trump on Wednesday by endorsing Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s re-election bid, a day after Mr. Trump roiled the party by declaring that he was not yet ready to support the speaker. in 2018. The endorsement of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State came as a surprise because Ms. McMorris Rodgers is one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal supporters and has been an early backer of him. But it also underscored how deeply divided Republicans are over their nominee’s candidacy, which many fear could damage down-ballot races if he does poorly against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and possibly even lose control of Congress in November. In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends program, Ms. McMorris Rodgers said she had spoken with Mr. Trump about her decision, but declined to say whether he supported her campaign or had offered any advice on how she should run her race. She did say that she and Mr. Ryan were friends and she would be happy to work with him in Congress. In endorsing her re-election effort, Ms. McMorris Rodgers said that “our country needs strong leadership now more than ever.” She added: “I believe that Speaker Paul D. Ryan will continue to lead our conference with integrity, courage and grace.” Her statement echoed the words used in a speech last week at a House GOP retreat by Mr. Pence, who called for unity within the Republican Party and urged members of both parties to put aside differences and focus instead on defeating Mrs. Clinton. Ms. McMorris Rodgers has emerged as an important figure within the GOP during this election cycle, playing up the role of women, veterans and small business owners in the Republican campaign in ways that have helped Republicans win elections around the country. She is considered a rising star within the Republican Party. She is chairman of a committee that oversees a number of issues related to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid and mental health services. She is married to Dan Newhouse, a former state senator from Spokane County who serves as vice chairwoman of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the president of the American Health Care Act Foundation. She also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee. She and Mr. Trump had met privately in March at the White House before his announcement speech to discuss her role in helping elect other candidates around the nation and her own race against Brad Rousch, a Democrat in eastern Washington state who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Newhouse in a primary earlier this year. But in recent weeks, Mr. Ryan had become increasingly concerned about Mr. Trump and said so publicly during interviews in August and September with CNN and NBC News, according to people familiar with the conversations. In those discussions, Mr. Ryan expressed concern about how Mr. Trump might affect Mrs. Clinton and Democrats in general, these people said. He also worried that if he endorsed Mr. Trump too soon, it might hurt him politically with voters, especially given the fact that he had endorsed Mitt Romney in 2012, only to see his former rival go on to defeat President Obama in that fall’s general election. On Tuesday, after a meeting between Mr. Pence and the speaker, Mr. Trump told reporters that Mr. Ryan would endorse him after all — although Mr. Ryan never explicitly made such a pledge — but said Mr. Ryan had “a lot of explaining to do” when asked why. At his rally Wednesday night in Colorado Springs, Colo., Mr. Trump reiterated the need for Mr. Ryan’s support and said the speaker needed to explain his position, adding: “He should come out right away, shouldn’t he?” But Mr. Trump’s comments drew sharp criticism from some fellow conservatives who accused the real estate mogul of trying to undermine the speaker and his efforts to unite Republicans behind him. Some Republican leaders were already growing frustrated that the presumptive presidential nominee seemed unwilling or unable to unify the fractured Republican base and rally its disparate factions behind him. And they expressed fears that Mr. Trump would drag them into political quicksand in November, potentially costing them seats in Congress and perhaps even handing the presidency to Mrs. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee. But the latest developments underscored just how difficult that task may be. While Mr. Trump said that Mr. Ryan was still supporting him and that his endorsement would help Republicans keep the majority, many other top party officials remained skeptical. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, one of Mr. Trump’s earliest congressional allies, told MSNBC Wednesday that Mr. Ryan should not give him his “automatic vote,” adding: “It seems like the only reason for doing that would be to try and get the nomination for himself.” And Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina’ s senior Republican lawmaker, said Wednesday that he thought the Trump endorsement “wasn’t necessarily helpful,” according to The Associated Press. Mr. Graham told CNN that he believed that Mr. Ryan was being pressured to endorse Mr. Trump. “Paul’s under pressure,” Mr. Graham said, adding, “I think Paul will do what is best for him.” He added: “He has a lot of respect for Donald, but I don’t know if it’s going to be enough. He is not ready for this job.” The White House declined to comment on whether it had put any pressure on Republicans to support Mr. Trump. But it did say that it would continue to work with lawmakers and other party leaders. A spokeswoman for Speaker John Boehner, who also endorsed Mr. Rubio, declined to comment. In an interview on Fox News Channel Wednesday morning, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Mr. Trump’s campaign was a “disaster” and said he was “not sure he can win.” The senator also told MSNBC that he was concerned about the impact Mr. Trump could have on Republicans in November if they nominate him as their candidate. He added that if the Republican nominee were Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump “would win by double digits.” Mr. Ryan and other top congressional Republicans are expected to meet Thursday at Trump Tower. They will discuss how the presumptive Republican presidential nominee might approach Congress. In addition to meeting with Mr. Trump, the group will include Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, chairman of the majority conference; Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; Senate Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana; Majority Conference Chairman Mike Conaway of Texas; Majority Deputy Whip Patrick Tiberi of Ohio; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah; Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama; Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee; Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri; Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina; Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee; and Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Mr. Ryan has been one of the most vocal opponents of the billionaire businessman. On Tuesday, the Wisconsin congressman called Mr. Trump’s comments that Judge Gonzalo P.“Gonzalo P.” Curiel should recuse himself from hearing cases involving Trump University because the judge is Hispanic “a textbook definition of racism,” adding that he “can’t believe we even need to talk about this stuff in America 2016.” He later apologized. But his criticism continued on Twitter: Mr. Trump “has repeatedly shown us why,” he wrote. “The man just doesn’t get that race relations matter. That women’s rights matter. That religious liberty matters. And that our military men and women deserve better than a guy who thinks war heroism means getting captured.” In March, when asked whether he thought Mr. Trump could beat Mrs. Clinton in November, Mr. Ryan replied, “No. No way. Not gonna happen. It would take something catastrophic for that to happen. I mean, it just wouldn’t be possible.” The speaker was referring to Mr. Trump’s controversial remarks that Mexican immigrants brought drugs into America. But the remarks also reflected a broader unease among many rank-and-file members about a potential matchup between Mr. Trump and the Democratic front-runner. “I’m just really worried that it would set back everything that Republicans stand for and everything the American people want to see in their next president,” the House member from Florida said at the time. But since then Mr. Ryan has softened his tone, saying he has begun to come around on Mr. Trump, and that he believes Mr. Trump has become more serious and less bombastic in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Ryan for his handling of the budget negotiations last year, which led to passage of legislation raising spending caps in exchange for cuts to domestic programs like food stamps. The two spoke at length after their joint appearance before reporters in December at the Capitol Hill Club, where the Republican Party holds its weekly lunches. “We had a great conversation,” Mr. Ryan recalled, noting that Mr. Trump was interested in learning about his ideas for overhauling entitlement programs. Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Trump seemed more knowledgeable about policy issues and that his views had evolved as a result of his experience running for office. The two discussed immigration reform and trade deals. Mr. Trump had previously suggested he was open to supporting both measures, though in interviews in January and February, Mr. Trump called them a waste of time and money, respectively. He also criticized Mr. Ryan for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform during the previous session. Mr. Ryan has since made clear his opposition to such proposals, arguing they would hurt workers at home and undermine efforts to secure the border with Mexico."
"SEOUL, South Korea — Keeping diplomatic developments coming at a head-snapping pace, the South Korean government said on Sunday that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had told President Moon Jae-in that he would abandon his nuclear weapons if the United States agreed to formally end the Korean War and promise not to invade his country. In a confidence-building gesture ahead of a proposed summit meeting with President Trump, a suddenly loquacious and conciliatory Mr. Kim also said he would invite experts and journalists from South Korea and the United States to watch the shutdown next month of his country’s only known underground nuclear test site. In Washington, Trump officials spoke cautiously about the chances of reaching a deal and laid out a plan for the dismantling of the North’s nuclear program, perhaps over a two-year period. That would be accompanied by a “full, complete, total disclosure of everything related to their nuclear program with a full international verification,” said John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser. The apparent concessions from the youthful leader were widely welcomed as promising signs of ending the standoff on the Korean Peninsula, frozen in place since fighting in the Korean War ended 65 years ago. But skeptics warned that North Korea previously made similar pledges of denuclearization on numerous occasions, with little or no intention of abiding by them. Mr. Kim’s friendly gestures, they said, could turn out to be nothing more than empty promises aimed at lifting sanctions on his isolated country. A South Korean government spokesman, Yoon Young-chan, provided remarkable details of a summit meeting the two Korean heads of state held on Friday, when Mr. Kim made history by becoming the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South. “I know the Americans are inherently disposed against us, but when they talk with us, they will see that I am not the kind of person who would shoot nuclear weapons to the south, over the Pacific or at the United States,” Mr. Kim told Mr. Moon, according to Mr. Yoon’s account. It was another in a series of startling statements by Mr. Kim, whose country threatened to do exactly those things during the height of nuclear tensions last year. Mr. Kim’s apparent willingness to negotiate away his nuclear arsenal was revealed just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke for the first time about a “good conversation” he had with Mr. Kim during his secret visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, over Easter weekend. Mr. Pompeo told ABC News in a broadcast on Sunday that the Trump administration’s objective was “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization” with North Korea, and that Mr. Kim was prepared to “lay out a map that would help us achieve” denuclearization. “We had an extensive conversation on the hardest issues that face our two countries,” Mr. Pompeo said. “I had a clear mission statement from President Trump. When I left, Kim Jong-un understood the mission exactly as I described it today.” But Mr. Bolton, a longtime critic of past diplomacy with North Korea, expressed skepticism on Sunday, recalling past moments that looked hopeful. Those would include a commitment by Pyongyang in the 1990s to give up its nuclear program and the destruction of a nuclear power cooling tower in 2008 as part of a similar promise. “We want to see real commitment,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “We don’t want to see propaganda from North Korea. We’ve seen words. We’ve seen words so far.” Asked about North Korea’s insistence on a promise by the United States not to invade, Mr. Bolton noted that was an old demand that had been rolled out on other occasions. “We’ve heard this before,” he said. “The North Korean propaganda playbook is an infinitely rich resource.” Mr. Trump sees the potential for a historic deal with Mr. Kim, “a breakthrough nobody would have imagined a few months ago,” Mr. Bolton told Fox News on Sunday, but his administration is not “starry eyed about what may happen here.” “I think it is going to happen; the dates and the places are still under discussion,” he said. “I think the president is eager to do it as soon as possible.” On Friday, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon signed a joint declaration recognizing “a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula” and “complete denuclearization” as a common goal of the two Koreas. But during the summit events, some of which were broadcast live around the world, Mr. Kim never publicly renounced his nuclear weapons. Even in the additional details released on Sunday by South Korean officials, Mr. Kim appeared to hedge his bets, indicating that denuclearizing his country could be a long process that required multiple rounds of negotiations and steps to build trust. But he laid out a vague idea of what his impoverished country would demand in return for giving up its nuclear weapons. “If we meet often and build trust with the United States, and if an end to the war and nonaggression are promised, why would we live in difficulty with nuclear weapons?” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying by South Korean officials. Mr. Moon briefed Mr. Trump on the meeting during a call on Saturday, telling him that Mr. Kim had said that he and Mr. Trump could “get along well,” to which Mr. Trump responded that he “looked forward” to their meeting. On Sunday, Mr. Moon also spoke with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to relay Mr. Kim’s willingness to open dialogue with Tokyo, which is threatened by the North’s nuclear weapons and missile development. The peacemaking comments stand in stark contrast to previous remarks and actions by Mr. Kim, who drove the Peninsula close to the brink of war last year by undertaking a series of missile and nuclear tests. He suddenly switched to diplomatic overtures this year, extending an offer to meet Mr. Trump, which, surprisingly, was accepted. A week ago, Mr. Kim announced an end to all nuclear and long-range missile tests and the closing of the nuclear test site in mountainous Punggye-ri, in northeast North Korea. In the meeting on Friday, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon also agreed to start talks this year with Washington to negotiate a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, one of the key security guarantees that the North has long demanded. But North Korea has so far offered no timeline for dismantling its nuclear weapons and facilities. Nor has it clarified how it defines a “nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,” and especially whether that means a withdrawal or significant reconfiguration of American troops based in South Korea, as it has demanded before. Even before Mr. Moon met with Mr. Kim, South Korean officials said any joint statement was bound to be vague on the terms of denuclearization because Mr. Kim would try to settle critical issues directly with Washington. If Mr. Kim intends to win a peace treaty, diplomatic recognition and billions of dollars in economic aid from Washington and its allies, as South Korean officials hope he does, trading away his nuclear arsenal is his biggest bargaining chip. He cannot reveal his hand too soon, South Korean officials said. Skeptics fear that Mr. Kim does not really intend to give up his nuclear weapons and is merely trying to soften his image, escape sanctions and make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to continue to threaten military action. But South Korean officials argue that Mr. Kim is sincere in trading his nuclear weapons for a promise to end hostilities and get Washington’s help to improve his country’s economy. North Korea’s promise to invite outsiders to Punggye-ri reflected “Mr. Kim’s determination to actively and pre-emptively deal with the process of verifying denuclearization,” Mr. Yoon said. In another conciliatory gesture toward South Korea, Mr. Kim made his own pledge of nonaggression toward the South. “I am determined not to repeat the painful history of the Korean War. As the same nation living on the same land, we should never shed blood again,” he told Mr. Moon, according to Mr. Yoon. Mr. Kim even vowed to readjust his country’s clock to match the time zone in South Korea, which with the rest of the region runs 30 minutes ahead of the North’s. “When I was sitting in the waiting room, I saw two clocks on the wall, one of the Seoul time and the other of the Pyongyang time, and I felt bad about it,” Mr. Kim was quoted as telling Mr. Moon. “Why don’t we reunify our clocks first?”","SEOUL, South Korea — Keeping diplomatic developments coming at a head-snapping pace, the South Korean government said on Sunday that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had told President Moon Jae-in that he would abandon his nuclear weapons if the United States agreed to formally end the Korean War and promise not to invade his country.

The announcement came after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson met for more than two hours with Mr. Moon in New York, where they discussed ways for Mr. Kim to give up nuclear arms without losing face or jeopardizing his regime. It was unclear whether Mr. Kim made any commitment to denuclearization in return. But the talks between the top American diplomat and Mr. Moon came as an apparent attempt to tamp down fears among some analysts here and abroad that the president might be rushing into negotiations too quickly with a man whose record includes assassinations, torture, public executions and other atrocities against the people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The talks also seemed aimed at reassuring Americans, many of whom are skeptical about a deal with Mr. Kim and have been urging Mr. Trump to hold out longer before agreeing to meet him. The White House has not yet announced when such a sit-down will take place, but it is expected to happen soon after the conclusion of this week’s Group of Seven economic leaders’ meetings. The announcement of a possible summit also comes amid rising tensions over the deployment by Mr. Kim of new intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching America and its allies in Asia. On Friday, North Korea fired four short-range projectiles off the east coast, which flew less than 300 miles, prompting condemnation and threats from both China and Russia. It was not clear what kind of response North Korea expected from those countries or how much influence either nation could exert to restrain it from further provocations. But the missile launches appeared intended as an early warning shot across Washington’s bow — the first salvo in what may prove a long war of words between the countries. And they underscored the risk of miscalculation or misunderstanding in dealing with a dictator like Mr. Kim, a master showman who appears to relish playing games and taunting adversaries and rivals alike. “The Trump administration is trying to get its ducks in order,” Robert Sutter, director of Asian studies at Georgetown University, wrote on Twitter. “It has no idea where the conversation with Kim is going.” A senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation described the latest development as an effort by Mr. Trump and the secretary of state to make sure that North Korea understands how serious Washington is about pursuing the path toward peace and reconciliation. It was not immediately clear why Mr. Kim had chosen now, when he faces mounting pressure at home from hardliners opposed to engagement and a growing threat from North Korea’s neighbors and regional powers to impose crippling sanctions and military action, to offer such concessions. “We are ready for dialogue anytime, anywhere without preconditions,” Mr. Kim reportedly said during the discussions in Pyongyang with Mr. Tillerson. Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump exchanged letters last year through intermediaries in Singapore. Since then, however, there have been few signs that their relationship was progressing beyond a series of tweets in the fall. After Mr. Tillerson’s visit to South Korea last weekend to discuss preparations for a potential meeting, it became increasingly likely that one was imminent. It was still unknown what form a summit could take, although Mr. Tillerson suggested it could include other nations besides just the two Koreas. South Korea, Japan, Australia and Canada are all members of the so-called Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. China, a member of that group as well, also expressed interest. A summit could come within weeks. On Saturday, South Korean news agencies reported that North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho met in Beijing with Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandan, a former ambassador to Washington and longtime confidant of China’s paramount leadership, the Communist Party chief Xi Jinping. Mr. Ri told reporters afterward that he and his counterpart had reached agreement on the agenda of the upcoming intergovernmental summits. He did not elaborate, but said he hoped that “the atmosphere surrounding” them would “be conducive to solving problems between us,” adding, “I am confident that we can resolve issues related to our relations in accordance with that spirit.” It was not clear when the two men might meet again., or if they would do so in advance of any planned Trump-Kim summit, although it seems unlikely. In addition to the talks with Mr. Kim, the president had another high-stakes encounter in Manhattan with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, his second since taking office, a session described by aides as cordial. The leaders agreed on the need for cooperation between their militaries against terrorism, including Islamic extremism. They were set to attend the opening ceremony of a World Cup soccer match later on Sunday in Moscow between England and Tunisia. But the talks between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump took a dramatic turn late on Saturday night after Mr. Putin and other senior officials met at an undisclosed location with Sergei N. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to Washington, who was fired last week amid allegations that he may have been involved in efforts by Russians to interfere in last year’s presidential election. A White House official said Saturday evening that the two men discussed “a range of issues,” but did not provide details. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump knew about the meeting before the news broke publicly early on Sunday morning. In response, a spokesman for Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of Mr. Trump’s harshest critics in Congress and a former prisoner of war during Vietnam, called on him to fire the national security adviser H. R. McMaster. “If true that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and others attended this secretive gathering, then National Security Advisor HR McMaster must resign immediately,” Mr. McCain wrote. Mr. McMaster has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks over reports of contacts with Michael T. Flynn, the retired general whom Mr. Trump abruptly dismissed last month as head of his transition team, which included discussions with the son and daughter-in-law of Mr. Putin about lifting sanctions imposed by Mr. Obama in retaliation for alleged interference in American elections. On Friday, after an article appeared about the contacts between General Flynn and the younger members of Mr. Putin’s inner circle, a top aide to the national security adviser issued a statement saying that no such meetings had taken place, although the administration had acknowledged some contact with Mr. Flynn about foreign policy matters, including Syria. On Sunday morning, the White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was unaware of the nature of the conversation. He also declined to say if he believed it was appropriate for Mr. Putin to meet with Donald J. McGahn II, the new counsel to the president, and Rob Porter, his staff director, without informing White House lawyers, even though the White House chief legal officer has access to all classified information. “I don’t know what happened there, I can tell you,” he said. “But we are going to get back to you.” Asked to elaborate on whether he thought that meeting had violated protocol or ethics rules, Mr. Spicer replied: “No, but I think we are getting into semantics here.” He added, “We will be able to answer those questions when the time comes. We will give you more detail than I am giving you now, because that is how these things work.” The episode came just days after it emerged that the F.B.I. interviewed several people connected to General Flynn’s conversations with Mr. Kislyak. Those interviews occurred last December, according to current and former law enforcement officials, as part of an inquiry into possible ties between associates of President Trump and Russian government operatives. The disclosure came from Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a Democrat who sits on the Intelligence Committee, during testimony before lawmakers investigating potential collusion between the Kremlin and the campaign. Mr. Schiff was asked why he felt compelled to reveal it now, given that he did not raise the issue until Sunday morning, after it became public through reporting by CNN. Mr. Schiff responded, “Because it’s important that you understand that these issues were raised and they were taken seriously, that it wasn’t something we could ignore.” Mr. Spicer’s comments echoed statements made earlier in the day by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who insisted that “there are plenty of examples where other presidents have done similar things” when discussing the contacts. She told Fox News Channel, “There’s nothing wrong with having communications between countries and governments.” Asked whether she considered that Mr. Kushner’s attendance was inappropriate, Ms. Sanders replied, “That wasn’t my understanding, but again I haven’t seen anything beyond reports on television.” She said the president’s sons — Eric, Ivanka and Don junior, all advisers on the transition team — were aware of Mr. Trump’s decision to invite them to a dinner meeting with the Russian delegation."
"NICE, France — At times it was hard to know who was on trial, the smuggler or the state. The defendant, Cédric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives. He would do it again, he suggested. Instead, when asked by a judge, “Why do you do all this?” Mr. Herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of France’s practice of rounding up and turning back Africans entering illegally from Italy in search of work and a better life. It was “ignoble,” he said. “There are people dying on the side of the road,” Mr. Herrou replied. “It’s not right. There are children who are not safe. It is enraging to see children, at 2 in the morning, completely dehydrated. “I am a Frenchman,” Mr. Herrou declared. The trial, which began on Wednesday, is no ordinary one. It has been substantially covered by the French news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of France’s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into Europe and the quandary they present. France, foremost among European nations, prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism, fraternity and solidarity. And yet, perhaps first among them, too, it is struggling to reconcile those values with the pressing realities of a smaller, more globalized world, including fear of terrorism. The contradictions are being played out in courtrooms, in politics and in farmers’ fields, on the sidewalks of Paris and in train stations from the Côte d’Azur to the northern port of Calais, where the government demolished a giant migrant camp in the fall. On the one hand, politicians in this year’s presidential election are competing to see who can take the toughest line on securing France’s borders. Most are promising a crackdown on migrants, with admission reserved for clear-cut cases of political persecution. Terrorist attacks, including the one last summer in Nice that killed 85 people, have exacerbated anti-migrant sentiment. But in these remote mountain valleys, where Jews fleeing the Nazis and the Vichy collaborators found refuge during World War II, Mr. Herrou has become something of a folk hero by leading a kind of loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north, many destined for Britain or Germany. His work has won him admiration for his resistance to the state and his stand that it is simply right to help one’s fellow man, woman or child. Others in this region seem to agree. In the square outside the pastel-colored courthouse, hundreds of sympathizers gathered and shouted, “We are all children of immigrants!” Mr. Herrou got a hero’s welcome as he descended the steep steps late in the evening, trailed by television cameras. Inside, not even the prosecutor, Jean-Michel Prêtre, seemed to want him there and praised his cause as “noble.” He asked for an eight-month sentence, but quickly reassured the court that it should be suspended, “of course.” Still, the law is the law. “He’s demonstrated a manifest intention to violate the law,” Mr. Prêtre told the court. “One can criticize it, but it’s got to be applied.” The verdict, which will be made by the panel of three judges who heard the case this week — there was no jury of peers — is scheduled to be announced on Feb. 10. The appeal for leniency was both an acknowledgment of widespread discomfort with the law, as a well as recognition of Mr. Herrou’s growing status in the region around Nice and its mountainous backcountry, the Roya Valley. Mr. Herrou was voted “Azuréen of the Year” last month by the readers of the leading local newspaper, Nice-Matin, to the fury of regional officials. “I am Cédric,” read one of the placards in the crowd. “Long live the righteous of the Roya,” read another. The courtroom on Wednesday was filled with people from the mountain — the men bearded and ponytailed, the women in duffel coats — who had come to support Mr. Herrou and who were convinced right was on their side. The notion that Mr. Herrou is trying to uphold what he sees as basic French values, rather than violating the law, is much of the reason he appears to enjoy a considerable measure of popular support. The argument formed the essence of his lawyer’s defense strategy. Remember the last word in the French Republic’s motto, “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité,” his lawyer, Zia Oloumi, told the court. “They are saying M. Herrou is endangering the Republic,” Mr. Oloumi told the three judges. “On the contrary, I think he is defending its values. “You see, you have got this value, fraternity, and the dictionary is quite clear,” Mr. Oloumi said. “Think about the impact of your decision on the practical application of the idea of fraternity.” Mr. Herrou was not making any political points, Mr. Oloumi insisted. He was merely responding to a humanitarian crisis in his own backyard; the Roya Valley had become a way station for migrants. The judges did not respond. But the lightness of the sentence called for by Mr. Prêtre suggested that the concepts invoked by Mr. Oloumi had resonance. Mr. Herrou’s accusers seemed most taken aback by his stubbornness. Not every migrant Mr. Herrou picks up is by the side of the road. He finds many outside the migrant camp across the Italian border at Ventimiglia, looking especially for women and children. The presiding judge, Laurie Duca, reminded him he had first been arrested in August, near his mountainside home at Breil-sur-Roya, with a van full of migrants. At that time, the prosecutor released him, suggesting that Mr. Herrou’s humanitarian motivations absolved him. That first arrest was evidently merely a warning. “After August, you said you knew it was illegal,” Judge Duca remarked in court. No matter. Mr. Herrou persisted, describing his migrant-smuggling work to journalists last fall and even occupying a disused summer camp owned by the state railroad when his own modest homestead became overwhelmed. At that point, in mid-October, the authorities decided they had had enough of him. “You were there, and you were extremely active,” the judge said. “Why so much press?” Mr. Herrou replied, “It is right that society should know about all this.” The judge and the prosecutor suggested that this time Mr. Herrou would not get the humanitarian pass he had benefited from previously. The local political establishment is furious with him. “At the very moment when we need strict controls, Mr. Herrou’s ideological, premeditated actions are a major risk,” Eric Ciotti, the president of the departmental council and a leading right-leaning member of Parliament, wrote in Nice-Matin. Mr. Prêtre, the prosecutor, suggested that Mr. Herrou’s persistence and openness had been his undoing. “Mr. Herrou acknowledges everything,” Mr. Prêtre said, with astonishment. “This trial springs from a communications strategy for a cause that I totally respect.” And yet, “this is what he told the police. He said, ‘I am violating the law.’ But I am the prosecutor. I must defend the law.”","NICE, France — At times it was hard to know who was on trial, the smuggler or the state.

The defendant, Cédric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives. in southeastern France, helping them cross into Spain and then back again, often with his own car, sometimes by foot, and always at great risk to himself and his family. But Mr. Herrou’s lawyer argued in court here last week that he should be acquitted because the French government itself has been encouraging people like him to help refugees in what is known as humanitarian smuggling — an illegal practice, but one that many European governments have tacitly condoned to stem the tide of desperate immigrants streaming across their borders from Africa, Asia and beyond. The case against Mr. Herrou — he faces up to three years in prison if convicted of aiding undocumented migration — was brought under a law passed by Parliament in December after France took up arms to fight Islamic State militants inside its territory. It has also become part of a broader debate about how much responsibility Europe bears for the influx of hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim asylum-seekers since late 2015, when they began arriving at record numbers along Italy’s southern coast. In recent weeks, Germany and Austria, two countries whose leaders were once among those most reluctant to accept refugees, have begun taking steps that could allow more refugees to enter legally. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said this month that her country would take responsibility for all Syrian children seeking protection in the bloc’s member states by next year. And in Austria, which currently accepts only Syrians fleeing war zones, Chancellor Christian Kern announced plans to open refugee centers in Hungary and Slovakia as well, so that they can process applications there before sending the applicants to Vienna for resettlement. But even the most generous interpretation of these moves does not go far enough. For many Europeans — including some who are sympathetic to refugees’ plight — it seems that any attempt to limit immigration amounts to appeasing xenophobes in countries such as Poland. “The idea is that you can do something without doing anything,” Mr. Kern told reporters this month, referring to the Austrian plan. “But I don’t think that’s possible.” In Nice, the trial has exposed deep divisions between the government’s tough line on undocumented migration and its stated desire to protect human rights. As the proceedings unfolded over five days, it became clear that Mr. Herrou was being tried not just on charges of smuggling, but for having helped immigrants to cross France’s border illegally and for being involved in human trafficking. He faces a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in jail, although it seems unlikely that France will ever send someone to prison for such offenses. The prosecutor asked for six months. The judge will decide whether Mr. Herrou deserves leniency when she rules. The trial, and its outcome, may set an important precedent for other cases around France — including that of another man accused of smuggling immigrants. That case involves Patrick Pelloux, a doctor who was charged with “complicity” for allegedly providing medical treatment to undocumented migrants, a crime punishable by four years in prison and €30,000, or roughly $31,000. But Mr. Pelloux’s lawyers argue that he was simply trying to save people’s lives and are asking for no penalty other than payment for legal fees. Mr. Herrou’s defense team has been careful to avoid making comparisons with the other cases — and has been equally cautious not to appear as though they are defending him on moral grounds. Instead, the lawyers say, the prosecution should focus on whether their client broke the laws against helping migrants to illegally leave France, not the larger question of why those laws exist. Mr. Pelloux, the defense lawyers say, is guilty only of providing humanitarian aid, while their client was doing the same thing but also helping the police catch smugglers and traffickers. “We don’t want the trial to end by saying, ‘Cedric Herrou is innocent,’” Jean Lainé, the lead attorney, told reporters outside the courthouse here. “It would mean we don’t care about people dying. We need to show we’re willing to change our law to help those dying in our name, not against it.” Mr. Herrou was arrested in October 2016 and spent more than two months behind bars in Toulon and Marseille, until prosecutors dropped charges of complicity and smuggling, leaving the charge of aiding migrants to cross the Spanish frontier, which carries a potential jail term of up to five years and a fine. He faces up to two years in jail if found guilty, though Mr. Herrou says he has never received money for the trips he made, nor did he make a profit. His defense is based in large part on a letter sent to President François Hollande, asking that France do more to prevent the deaths of asylum seekers crossing through Libya. Mr. Herrou is an electrician and father of three. In 2013, after seeing images on television of migrants drowning off Lampedusa in Italy, he decided to help them by driving his van across Europe and delivering food, water and clothes to people stranded at sea. He was arrested in October 2015 and charged with aiding illegal immigration, but was released without charge. The case against him has been criticized as politically motivated, but it is still pending. Mr. Herrou’s lawyer, Me Jean-Paul Teissonnière, said that his client had not broken any laws and had acted out of humanitarian motives. He also noted that the French government was aware that Mr. Herrou’s actions were helping save lives. The prosecutor’s office is seeking six years’ imprisonment for each count and €75,000 ($80,000) for damages, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters. The trial will take place from April 3 to April 7 in Montpellier, southern France, where Mr. Herrou lives. Mr. Herrou is one of several prominent figures who have taken up the cause of refugees since last year. Others include former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister under whom he served, both now members of Parliament; and Mr. Macron, then economy minister and later president. But Mr. Herrou stands alone among those politicians in having gone so far as to risk arrest to aid the migrants. He said in the documentary, “I am not afraid. I am doing what my conscience tells me.” In another scene, Mr. Herrou is shown standing in front of a line of cars waiting to cross into Spain. A man asks why he does this when it could cost him everything, including the van, which he bought with savings for retirement. “Because I can,” Mr. Herrou replies. He says the same thing about his decision to drive across Europe to rescue migrants, even though he knows that if caught he faces prison time and fines totaling hundreds of thousands of euros. The film ends with him being led away in handcuffs as his wife cries out: “You are going to jail!” Mr. Herrou’s supporters say he should be praised, rather than punished, for taking action on behalf of others who might otherwise perish at sea. They note that Mr. Macron himself has called for greater efforts by European countries to share responsibility for dealing with refugees. Mr. Herrou’s lawyer, Me Teissonnière, has argued that his client had done nothing wrong. “He has been accused of violating the law because of a political choice. That is unacceptable,” he told The Associated Press in Paris, adding: “The only way we can fight terrorism is by respecting human rights.” But the prosecution argues that Mr. Herrou’s actions put other drivers at risk of criminal charges and could encourage other citizens to follow suit. It cites a report issued by a parliamentary commission that found that migrants often pay smugglers for passage by boat. In addition, it notes that the government is already working with nongovernmental organizations to provide assistance to those trying to reach Lampedusa and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Sea. The prosecution’s request is unusually high for such cases, and is meant to send a message to discourage similar behavior. Mr. Herrou has also faced criticism in some quarters because he is white and middle class. Some critics say his activism is hypocritical, given his own privileged background. Others argue that the fact that he is an elected official makes him all the more culpable. “It is very easy to criticize someone else, and to criticize someone who is less fortunate, and who has no power,” said Mr. Herrou in the documentary."
