"WASHINGTON — President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting. “I hope you can let this go,” the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo. The documentation of Mr. Trump’s request is the clearest evidence that the president has tried to directly influence the Justice Department and F.B.I. investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia. Late Tuesday, Representative Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, demanded that the F.B.I. turn over all “memoranda, notes, summaries and recordings” of discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey. Such documents, Mr. Chaffetz wrote, would “raise questions as to whether the president attempted to influence or impede” the F.B.I. Mr. Comey wrote the memo detailing his conversation with the president immediately after the meeting, which took place the day after Mr. Flynn resigned, according to two people who read the memo. It was part of a paper trail Mr. Comey created documenting what he perceived as the president’s improper efforts to influence a continuing investigation. An F.B.I. agent’s contemporaneous notes are widely held up in court as credible evidence of conversations. Mr. Comey shared the existence of the memo with senior F.B.I. officials and close associates. The New York Times has not viewed a copy of the memo, which is unclassified, but one of Mr. Comey’s associates read parts of it to a Times reporter. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey, according to the memo. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey that Mr. Flynn had done nothing wrong, according to the memo. Mr. Comey did not say anything to Mr. Trump about curtailing the investigation, replying only: “I agree he is a good guy.” In a statement, the White House denied the version of events in the memo. “While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,” the statement said. “The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.” Mr. Chaffetz’s letter, sent to the acting F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, set a May 24 deadline for the internal documents to be delivered to the House committee. The congressman, a Republican, was criticized in recent months for showing little of the appetite he demonstrated in pursuing Hillary Clinton to pursue investigations into Mr. Trump’s associates. But since announcing in April that he will not seek re-election in 2018, Mr. Chaffetz has shown more interest in the Russia investigation, and held out the potential for a subpoena on Tuesday, a notably aggressive move as most Republicans have tried to stay out of the fray. In testimony to the Senate last week, Mr. McCabe said, “There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.” Mr. McCabe was referring to the broad investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The investigation into Mr. Flynn is separate. A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment. Mr. Comey created similar memos — including some that are classified — about every phone call and meeting he had with the president, the two people said. It is unclear whether Mr. Comey told the Justice Department about the conversation or his memos. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last week. Trump administration officials have provided multiple, conflicting accounts of the reasoning behind Mr. Comey’s dismissal. Mr. Trump said in a television interview that one of the reasons was because he believed “this Russia thing” was a “made-up story.” The Feb. 14 meeting took place just a day after Mr. Flynn was forced out of his job after it was revealed he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone conversations he had had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Despite the conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey, the investigation of Mr. Flynn has proceeded. In Virginia, a federal grand jury has issued subpoenas in recent weeks for records related to Mr. Flynn. Part of the Flynn investigation is centered on his financial links to Russia and Turkey. Mr. Comey had been in the Oval Office that day with other senior national security officials for a terrorism threat briefing. When the meeting ended, Mr. Trump told those present — including Mr. Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions — to leave the room except for Mr. Comey. Alone in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump began the discussion by condemning leaks to the news media, saying that Mr. Comey should consider putting reporters in prison for publishing classified information, according to one of Mr. Comey’s associates. Mr. Trump then turned the discussion to Mr. Flynn. After writing up a memo that outlined the meeting, Mr. Comey shared it with senior F.B.I. officials. Mr. Comey and his aides perceived Mr. Trump’s comments as an effort to influence the investigation, but they decided that they would try to keep the conversation secret — even from the F.B.I. agents working on the Russia investigation — so the details of the conversation would not affect the investigation. Mr. Comey was known among his closest advisers to document conversations that he believed would later be called into question, according to two former confidants, who said Mr. Comey was uncomfortable at times with his relationship with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey’s recollection has been bolstered in the past by F.B.I. notes. In 2007, he told Congress about a now-famous showdown with senior White House officials over the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretapping program. The White House disputed Mr. Comey’s account, but the F.B.I. director at the time, Robert S. Mueller III, kept notes that backed up Mr. Comey’s story. The White House has repeatedly crossed lines that other administrations have been reluctant to cross when discussing politically charged criminal investigations. Mr. Trump has disparaged the continuing F.B.I. investigation as a hoax and called for an inquiry into his political rivals. His representatives have taken the unusual step of declaring no need for a special prosecutor to investigate the president’s associates. The Oval Office meeting occurred a little over two weeks after Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Comey to the White House for a lengthy, one-on-one dinner at the residence. At that dinner, on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey at least two times for a pledge of loyalty — which Mr. Comey declined, according to one of Mr. Comey’s associates. In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” After the meeting, Mr. Comey’s associates did not believe there was any way to corroborate Mr. Trump’s statements. But Mr. Trump’s suggestion last week that he was keeping tapes has made them wonder whether there are tapes that back up Mr. Comey’s account. The Jan. 27 dinner came a day after White House officials learned that Mr. Flynn had been interviewed by F.B.I. agents about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. On Jan. 26, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, told the White House counsel about the interview, and said Mr. Flynn could be subject to blackmail by the Russians because they knew he had lied about the content of the calls.","WASHINGTON — President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump urged senators this month to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most Americans have health insurance and use the proceeds to slash the top tax rate paid by the richest Americans, a suggestion that pitted his priorities against his daughter and Republican senators intent on helping the middle class. In the end, the president accepted only a partial victory. He got the repeal of the health law’s individual mandate, but gave up on an income tax rate cut that would have directly benefited him personally. Instead, Ivanka Trump and her allies in the Senate prevailed in their push to include an expanded child tax credit. “This was certainly an uphill battle, especially given that it is not an issue that is as widely understood,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a leading advocate of the expanded child tax credit. “We didn’t necessarily have the sense that the president was opposed to it. I still don’t have that sense. I think if he had been, things would have worked out differently than they did.” Two White House officials pushed back against the notion that Ms. Trump had split with her father. They said middle-income tax relief was one of the president’s priorities and that Ms. Trump worked in lock step with the administration on all aspects of tax reform. But the fight is actually continuing. Later this week, Mr. Lee and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, will take on another top priority of the president’s, cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The senators plan to offer an amendment that would cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, instead of 20 percent, and use the proceeds to help families with little or no income tax liabilities benefit from the expanded child credit and to allow the child credit to rise with inflation. A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, wasted no time declaring the president’s opposition on Wednesday. Mr. Trump was not secretive about his desire for a lower income tax rate for the nation’s wealthiest families. This month, he tweeted his desire: But his suggestion that the top rate come down clashed directly with the push to assist the middle class. The president had also pressed to eliminate the estate tax, a provision that would have hugely benefited his heirs. Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee did vote unanimously to add the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate to their bill, effectively giving themselves more than $300 billion to spend on additional tax cuts. Then lawmakers went to work to devote that money to priorities other than lowering the top income tax rate or cutting the estate tax. Senators Lee and Rubio enlisted Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who talks frequently with Ms. Trump, and Senator Dean Heller of Nevada to push the child credit expansion in the Finance Committee. “It seemed to me to be common sense if our goal was to deliver as much of a tax break for the middle class on down,” Mr. Scott said. The victory somewhat improved the optics of a bill that most opinion polls suggest is unpopular among a majority of the American public. By expanding the credit to $2,000 per child from $1,650, as initially proposed in the Senate bill, Republicans substantially reduced the number of middle-class families who are likely to face an immediate tax increase under the bill. The higher child tax credit in the Senate tax plan avoids tax increases for 3.5 million families, compared to the less generous credit increase in the House plan. (Because that credit and all other individual tax breaks in the bill are scheduled to expire in 2025 to satisfy Senate procedural rules, all middle-class families face a looming tax hike in 2026 if a future Congress does not intervene.) Republicans have drawn criticism in the House and the Senate for pitching their tax plans as benefiting the middle class, only to see analysts conclude that, because they eliminate some tax breaks while lowering rates, many working families would actually see their taxes go up. Early analyses suggested that roughly a quarter of middle-class families could see their taxes rise in a year if the initial Senate bill became law, compared to about half of families under the House bill. Senate Republicans worried about those distributional effects, Mr. Scott said. By expanding the credit and also allowing taxpayers of higher incomes to claim it, he added, “That combination solved the problem for a lot of people.” Democrats have criticized the decision to include mandate repeal in the tax bill. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will lead to 13 million fewer Americans choosing to buy health insurance or sign up for government-provided insurance such as Medicaid, and its analysis finds the move will, on balance, reduce incomes for workers earning $30,000 and below, because they will receive fewer government benefits and subsidies for care. The Republican bill is “a plan to take health care away from people,” Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, said in a Facebook town hall meeting on Tuesday night. He offered partial praise, though, for the expanded child credit. “If that were done the right way,” he said, “it really would help working families a lot. As the provision is now drafted, it does too much for people like senators, frankly, and families in high-income categories, and not enough for working families.” Republicans say mandate repeal, which is politically popular, gives consumers the freedom to choose whether they buy coverage without fear of government penalty. They say the budget office is wrong to score benefits that consumers willingly forgo as lost income. But they are happy to accept the analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation that the move will free up more than $300 billion — through reduced government spending — that can be used to offset tax reductions in the bill. That money gave an opening to Mr. Lee, Mr. Rubio and Ms. Trump, who had worked together for months laying the groundwork for the child credit expansion. The group was disappointed in the House version of the tax bill and the initial Senate bill, which expanded the credit from $1,000 today, but counteracted that expansion with other lost tax breaks for families. “The nominal expansion in the original bill was quite arguably completely eaten up by other changes,” Mr. Lee said. Neither Mr. Scott nor Mr. Lee would characterize their conversations with the president during that negotiating period, but Mr. Lee said there were several competing ideas for how to allocate the $300 billion. Had Mr. Trump’s request for a 35 percent top rate been granted in full, Republicans would have delivered even larger benefits to high earners, whom the joint committee judges already to be the largest recipients of tax cuts under the plan. Mr. Trump would have likely seen his tax bill shrink considerably. White House officials say the president was pleased simply to see the mandate repeal included. And while Mr. Lee is still pushing for a further expansion of the child credit — one that would allow more low-income families with little or no income tax liabilities to benefit from it — he called the overall bill “a step in the right direction.” He, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Scott and Mr. Heller are all expected to vote for it on the Senate floor.","WASHINGTON — President Trump urged senators this month to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most Americans have health insurance and use the proceeds to slash the top tax rate paid by the richest Americans, a suggestion that pitted his priorities against his daughter and Republican senators intent on helping the middle class.

"WASHINGTON — President Obama sought to reassure American Jews that he is a fierce supporter of Israel as he visited an influential synagogue here on Friday to defend his quest for a nuclear agreement with Iran. The visit was also an attempt to mend a strained relationship with parts of the American Jewish community that dates to the start of Mr. Obama’s presidency and has worsened in recent months. “When I hear some people say that disagreements over policy belie a general lack of support of Israel, I must object — and I object forcefully,” Mr. Obama said. But he said he was unwilling to “paper over differences.” Calling himself an “honorary member of the tribe,” Mr. Obama, wearing a yarmulke and standing at the bimah where rabbis chant from the Torah, told about 1,000 people in the packed sanctuary at Adas Israel, a large Conservative congregation about three miles from the White House, that the United States had an “enduring friendship with the people of Israel” and “unbreakable bonds with the state of Israel” that could never be weakened. “Our commitment to Israel’s security, and my commitment to Israel’s security is, and always will be, unshakable,” Mr. Obama said. And, he said, “it is precisely because I care so deeply about the state of Israel that I feel a responsibility to speak out honestly about what I think would lead to long-term security and to the preservation of a true democracy in the Jewish homeland.” He added, “I believe that’s two states for two peoples, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.”  The president used the roughly 30-minute speech to vow that he would reject a “bad deal” or one that failed to meet his objective of cutting off Tehran’s pathways to developing a bomb, and argued that an agreement was in Israel’s best security interests. Above all, Mr. Obama said, “the people of Israel must always know: America has its back.” It was unclear how much a single visit to a synagogue would assuage Jewish concerns, but White House officials indicated that it was part of what they described as a sustained effort to reach out to American Jews before the June 30 deadline for completing the Iran accord.  In his remarks, the president worked to put his support for Israel in a personal context and to knock down a perception among some Jewish leaders and activists that he lacks a deep emotional connection to Israel and its people. As a young man inspired by the civil rights struggle in the United States, Mr. Obama said, he came to know Israel “through these incredible images of kibbutzim,” the collective communities that formed the backbone of the Jewish state. “Those values in many ways came to be my own values,” Mr. Obama said. The president’s views on Israel were forged during his time in Chicago, when he became friendly with a group of prominent Jewish Democrats that included Lester Crown, a Chicago-based industrialist, the federal judge Abner J. Mikva, and Newton N. Minow, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. He came to share their approach to Israel, which involved staunch support for the Jewish state coupled with a willingness to criticize its policies.  Years later as he campaigned for president, Mr. Obama would tell a group of Jewish leaders in Cleveland that a person did not have to be pro-Likud — a conservative and hawkish party in Israel — to be pro-Israel. At a White House meeting during his first year in office, he questioned whether a stance that put “no daylight” between the United States and Israel was productive, telling a group of Jewish leaders that it had yielded no progress during the previous administration. At the same time, Mr. Obama has sought close ties with Jewish communities during his time in office, has provided substantial military assistance to Israel and has selected Jews to serve in prominent posts in his administration, including his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, and Jacob J. Lew, now Treasury secretary. He was the first president to host a Passover Seder at the White House, now an annual custom. In his re-election in 2012, Mr. Obama received 70 percent of the Jewish vote.  But Mr. Obama’s decision to go to Cairo early on in his tenure — before he made a presidential visit to Jerusalem, where he had traveled as a candidate — and speak in stark terms about the pain and daily humiliations Palestinians had suffered was an indication to his critics that he would be biased against Israel in his attempts to promote a two-state solution. That sense has deepened as Mr. Obama has clashed bitterly and openly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel over the Iran accord and other issues, and as conservative Jews have increasingly lavished campaign contributions on Republicans.  Supporters of Mr. Obama say his critics have long misunderstood his views on Israel. “There’s been a lamentable partisanship that has come to surround Israel policy, and some confuse the occasional challenges in the relationship between Obama and Bibi with the president’s overall level of support for Israel,” said Norman L. Eisen, a former ambassador to the Czech Republic and longtime friend of Mr. Obama’s who is active in pro-Israel circles, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname. “None of those critiques are accurate, or reflective of how Obama feels about Israel.” “Anybody who knows him personally knows that he is a very strong supporter of Israel and of the Jewish people,” Mr. Eisen said, calling it “part of his identity.” Mr. Obama’s speech on Friday offered no shifts in position, angering some pro-Israel leaders who said he had missed an opportunity to make concrete promises that would have allayed their concerns, such as by vowing to veto any anti-Israel resolution at the United Nations, including one calling for the creation of a Palestinian state. “He was really attempting the pull the wool over pro-Israel eyes,” said Morton A. Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America. “This speech showed no respect for the intelligence of the pro-Israel community, which is horrified by the catastrophe of the Iran deal.” Mr. Klein said he had predicted early on that Mr. Obama would be “the most hostile president to Israel, ever,” based on the Cairo speech and his membership in what he called an “anti-Semitic church” led by the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., the African-American pastor whom the president called his spiritual mentor. Mr. Obama has since broken with Mr. Wright.  Still, Mr. Obama, who received an exceedingly warm reception from his audience — composed of prominent Jewish leaders, lawmakers and opinion leaders, many of them from the more liberal wing of American Jews — went out of his way to acknowledge that many Jews in Israel and the United States regard the Palestinians as bad actors.  “The Palestinians are not the easiest of partners,” Mr. Obama said. “The neighborhood is dangerous, and we cannot expect Israel to take existential risks with their security.” Some Jewish leaders heard in that statement an attempt by Mr. Obama to reach out to Jewish Americans uncertain of his motives. “For the president of the United States to say that publicly, even in that gentle a way, is notable,” said Nathan J. Diament, executive director for public policy at the Orthodox Union, an umbrella organization for Orthodox Jewry. Mr. Obama’s visit to Adas Israel was the first time in more than 30 years and only the fourth time that a sitting American president had spoken in a synagogue. William Howard Taft was the first in 1909, when he addressed a congregation in Pittsburgh, followed by Presidents Dwight D.

"Seat-free subway cars on crowded routes. Extra cars added to trains on the C line. Medical workers deployed at stations to quickly remove sick passengers. More countdown clocks. These were some of the pieces of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s long-anticipated, roughly $800 million emergency rescue plan for New York City’s troubled subway system, which was announced on Tuesday. The authority’s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, outlined a sweeping set of fixes that he vowed would turn around steadily deteriorating service. The plan included at least 30 separate measures to address the major problems plaguing the system, including antiquated signals and subway fires, and called for hiring 2,700 new workers. “We’re here because the New York City subway system no doubt is in distress, and we’re here looking for solutions,” Mr. Lhota said during a news conference at the authority’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Asked when subway riders might start to see an improvement, Mr. Lhota said, “relatively quickly.” And he said he wanted to be held accountable as officials enacted his plan. Among Mr. Lhota’s more interesting ideas: Subway officials will remove the seats from a couple of train cars on certain lines to fit more people on board. He said that Boston had tried the approach, and that in New York it could add 25 more riders on each car. The authority will start with a pilot program on the shuttle train between Times Square and Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan and the L train between Brooklyn and Manhattan, Mr. Lhota said. Subway officials said they hoped to start the program as soon as possible, perhaps later this year. The plan includes adding extra cars to trains on the C line, accelerating repairs to 1,300 signals that cause the most problems, installing countdown clocks more quickly and overhauling more train cars — 1,100 per year — to improve reliability. The authority will also create a public dashboard to more clearly show riders how the system is performing. The improvements come with a steep bill — about $450 million in operating costs and $380 million in capital investment — and Mr. Lhota called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to help fund the plan. He suggested the state and the city split the costs evenly, noting that he had “tremendous respect” for the mayor and wanted to work with him. “I will do everything I can to convince him that this is the right thing to do for the people of the City of New York,” Mr. Lhota said, adopting a softer tone than he showed last week, when he attacked Mr. de Blasio for not showing empathy for subway riders. The subway rescue plan came amid a bitter feud that has broken into the public arena between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the authority and urged the city to help him fix the subway, and Mr. de Blasio. The mayor has resisted pouring more money into the subway, since the state runs the system. At a hastily called news conference at a City Hall subway station on Tuesday evening, Mr. de Blasio called Mr. Lhota’s plan an “important first step,” but refused to commit new city money to support it. Mr. de Blasio, who at times could barely be heard over the din of trains and the shouts of heckling straphangers, said that it was “up to the M.T.A. to right the ship.” He called it “quite an amazing coincidence” that the operating money called for by Mr. Lhota was the same amount that City Hall has accused the state of having taken from authority. “I’m trying to be straightforward with the people of the city and the taxpayers of the city, that we cannot put our resources in when we know the state still owes the M.T.A. money,” he added. “It’s as simple as that.” On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo called Mr. Lhota’s plan “substantive and realistic,” and he agreed to split the cost of the rescue plan with the city. “Now is not the time for pointing fingers, but for moving forward — together as New Yorkers,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. New York’s subway has long been the lifeblood of the city, but delays have increased and a series of accidents have raised concerns over safety. As the century-old system grapples with aging infrastructure and a booming ridership of nearly six million people each day, New Yorkers have grown increasingly frustrated that they cannot rely on the subway to get them where they need to be in a timely manner. It was not the first time the authority has tried to take on the problem of subway delays — officials released a six-point plan in May focused on the Eighth Avenue line in Manhattan. But the combination of Mr. Lhota’s credibility and the growing urgency over the near-constant problems has raised the stakes. Mr. Lhota, who ran against Mr. de Blasio for mayor in 2013, returned to lead the authority in June to help turn around the subway after an earlier stint as chairman. Asked on Tuesday whether the agency might raise fares if the city did not provide funding for the rescue plan, Mr. Lhota dismissed the idea. The authority would continue to stick to its schedule of modest fare increases every two years, Mr. Lhota told reporters. “Raising fares is not an option,” he said. Last month, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who might be considering a presidential run in 2020, declared a state of emergency for the subway and tasked Mr. Lhota with submitting a rescue plan within 30 days. But after Mr. Cuomo appeared to take responsibility for the crisis, the governor argued last week that the city owned the subway system and should take a primary role in fixing it. On Tuesday, the authority assembled an advisory board to assist with the rescue plan, including former Mayor David N. Dinkins, a mentor and ally of Mr. de Blasio who sat in the front row at the news conference. In a statement, Mr. Dinkins said he saw how critical the subway was to the city during his time as mayor and urged elected leaders to work together. Throughout the day, aides to the mayor and the governor had spent time calling interest groups and potential allies to argue their case in the dispute between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, according to three people with direct knowledge of the calls who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. The lobbying effort provided another example of how City Hall and Albany are jockeying for political advantage, both in front of the cameras and behind the scenes, on an issue that could be potentially damaging to both leaders. At least one member of the advisory board, Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, was skeptical of the proposal to remove seats from subway cars. “My standard is my mom,” Mr. Russianoff said. “Would she like to stand all the way from Midtown, where she used to work, to Sheepshead Bay? The answer is a resounding no.” The idea for subway cars without seats may have come from Boston, but they are hardly widespread there. Joe Pesaturo, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which runs Boston’s subway, said only two cars on the Red Line had most of their seats removed back in 2008. Eventually, about half of the seats were added back.",Seat-free subway cars on crowded routes. Extra cars added to trains on the C line.,"Seat-free subway cars on crowded routes.

"BAGHDAD — The Islamic State militant group attacked the ancient archaeological site of Nimrud in northern Iraq and damaged it with heavy vehicles, Iraq’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said Thursday. It was the latest in a series of attacks on ancient structures and artifacts in Syria and Iraq that the group has destroyed in the name of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Last week, Islamic State militants videotaped themselves destroying statues and artifacts in the Mosul Museum and at the Nergal Gate entryway to ancient Nineveh. The militants captured the city during its offensive blitz through much of Iraq last June. “The terrorist gangs of ISIS are continuing to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity after they committed a new crime that belongs to its idiotic series,” the ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page, referring to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Nimrud is the sprawling site of a city founded by the Assyrian King Shalamansar I, who died in 1245 B.C. Among the most impressive objects at Nimrud are the colossal statues known as “lamassu,” mythological creatures that depict either lions or winged bulls with bearded human heads. Pairs of the 17-ton statues are at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum. Many of the massive Nimrud statues remain buried at the site. But the ISIS video from the Mosul Museum clearly shows at least one statue from Nimrud being defaced. And the site has many areas that archaeologists have not yet explored. George C. Papagiannis, the Unesco world heritage officer in charge in Iraq from 2009 to 2011, said the loss of any artifacts from Nimrud was a dark blow to historical preservation. “These extremists are trying to destroy the entire cultural heritage of the region in an attempt to wipe the slate clean and rewrite history in their own brutal image,” he said. He added that Nimrud was recently nominated by the Iraqi government to be placed on Unesco’s list of world heritage sites, locations chosen for their “universal value.” Ihsan Fethi, a member of the Iraqi Architects Society, said, “I cannot even describe the immensity of this loss.” He added, “This is one of the most famous and probably one of the most important sites in the world.” Nimrud is also famous for its bas-reliefs and steles that depict scenes of war and hunting as well as fantastical figures like bird-headed genies. Many of those are in museums. As well, Nimrud was the site of extensive excavations that yielded carved ivory, jewelry, crowns and other artifacts that are stored in the archaeological museum in Baghdad, which in recent days reopened to the public. But the Nimrud site itself has suffered since the United States-led invasion in 2003, when it was virtually abandoned as Iraqi state structures collapsed. Looters stole and damaged many sculptures. However, Mr. Fethi said, the site was partly safeguarded by its remote location, and until now, its major structures were in good condition. “Leaving these gangs without punishment will encourage them to eliminate human civilization entirely, especially the Mesopotamian civilization, which cannot be compensated,” the ministry added in its statement. It called on the United Nations Security Council to come to Iraq’s aid. The destruction also comes on the heels of several years of wholesale ransacking of Syria’s ancient sites by many parties in the country’s chaotic conflict. Mohammad Rabia Chaar, a Syrian writer and journalist now living in Belgium, said he had returned to Syria to support the uprising against Bashar al-Assad but became disillusioned in part because of the looting and destruction, and was eventually driven out by threats from Islamic State militants, before they in turn were largely driven from that province last year. ”Go and see Idlib, how all the ancient hills have been destroyed and looted, how bulldozers are digging.” he said. “The feeling of sickness is growing more and more, day after day, against these imperialist Muslims. Daesh wants people with no memory, with no history, with no culture, no past, no future.” He said that while human lives were worth more than statues, erasing history and civilization was “killing them not physically but because of their thoughts.”","BAGHDAD — The Islamic State militant group attacked the ancient archaeological site of Nimrud in northern Iraq and damaged it with heavy vehicles, Iraq’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said Thursday.

"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans took a significant step toward passing a sweeping tax overhaul on Tuesday, with a key panel giving its approval and several wavering senators indicating they would support the tax package, helping clear the way for full Senate consideration later this week. Passage of the tax overhaul, which seemed uncertain on Monday, strengthened considerably on Tuesday after the Senate Budget Committee voted along party lines to advance the plan. A flurry of last-minute deal making helped garner the support of a few Republican lawmakers who had expressed concerns about the $1.5 trillion package, including its treatment of small businesses and its effect on the deficit. The rapid turnaround underlines the pressure Republicans face to pass a tax cut and notch a significant legislative victory in their first year controlling both Congress and the White House. To help push the effort forward, President Trump went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a lunch meeting with Republican senators, where he made promises to some and admonished another. “I think we’re going to get it passed,” he said later at the White House. “It’s going to have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive — the largest in the history of our country — tax cut.” Republicans emerged from the lunch increasingly optimistic about the bill’s fate and playing down the concerns that had threatened to bedevil its passage. Three key Republican holdouts, Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, sounded positive about the bill on Tuesday after gaining assurances from Mr. Trump and the Republican leadership that their worries would be addressed. Several hurdles remain, however, including resolving differences with the House version of the tax bill, which differs in significant ways from that of the Senate. Both bills cut taxes on businesses and individuals, but differ in the scope and timing of those cuts. The Senate bill would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent. For individuals, it would make tax cuts temporary and create seven income tax brackets, with a bottom rate of 10 percent and a top marginal rate of 38.5 percent, down from the current rate of 39.6 percent. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that he felt encouraged that the two chambers would be able to align their bills but that the House would not simply pass the Senate legislation. “For as much common ground as we have, there are some areas where we are taking different approaches that will be worked, and can only be worked out, in a conference,” Mr. Brady said. Lawmakers are also awaiting a report from the Joint Committee on Taxation that would show the effects of the proposed tax cuts on the economy. That analysis is important, since it will indicate the extent to which the cuts will bolster growth and avoid adding to the deficit. Outside analysts expect the assessment to demonstrate that the Senate bill does not create nearly enough growth to generate revenues to offset those lost via tax cuts, essentially undermining Republicans’ claims that the bill would pay for itself. Mr. Corker, who has voiced the loudest concerns about the bill’s effect on the deficit, said on Tuesday that he received assurances that the final legislation would include a mechanism to avoid ballooning the debt, which has passed $20 trillion. While the exact details were not specified, the bill is expected to include some type of trigger that would require certain taxes to increase if the package does not generate as much revenue as projected. “I think we’ve come to a pretty acceptable place, from my standpoint,” said Mr. Corker, who has stated that he would be unable to vote for the bill if it added to the federal deficit. That trigger, however, could complicate the bill’s passage. Several other Republican lawmakers, including Mr. Brady and Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, are resistant to the idea of including a trigger that would increase taxes. “I’m not too keen on automatic tax increases,” Mr. Kennedy said. “I’m just not too excited about this idea of automatically tying our hands.” Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by Charles G. and David H. Koch, also blasted the idea, calling a trigger mechanism “antithetical to the principles of the unified tax framework” that lawmakers have proposed. Other holdouts, like Mr. Johnson, appear to have been swayed by admonishments or assurances. Mr. Johnson objected to the bill on the grounds that it did not do enough to help so-called pass-through businesses, which pass their income on to their owners. During lunch with Mr. Trump, the president chastised Mr. Johnson over objections he raised in the meeting, telling the senator at one point, “Come on, Ron,” according to a person familiar with the discussion who declined to be identified because the event was not public. Mr. Johnson voted for the bill on Tuesday, telling reporters: “The good news is, everybody agrees it’s a problem, it has to be fixed. I just keep getting assurances it’s going to be fixed. I just want to see how.” Other Republican senators who have been skeptical of the tax bill also appeared ready to back it. Ms. Collins, who has not yet thrown her support behind the bill, said that she felt more optimistic about the plan after meeting with the president. “I believe that a lot of my concerns, it appears, are going to be addressed and that I’m going to be getting the opportunity to offer amendments on the Senate floor,” she said. Ms. Collins said that the president was supportive of her wishes that $10,000 of property taxes be deductible under the Senate plan, a change that would be similar to the compromise that House Republicans made on the repeal of the state and local tax deduction. She also said that Mr. Trump was supportive of backing legislation to help stabilize health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act, which she said would help mitigate the effects of ending the law’s requirement that most people have insurance, as the tax bill would do. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said that Senate Republicans were increasingly united about repealing the requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a penalty. He said that Mr. Trump was very involved in the details of the tax package on Tuesday and that he took several questions from senators. “He had a vigorous back-and-forth,” Mr. Alexander said. Both Mr. Alexander and Ms. Collins demurred when asked whether they would be concerned if the Joint Committee on Taxation report showed that the bill would increase the deficit even with additional economic growth. “I’m not going to be hypothetical about that,” Mr. Alexander said. Democrats on the Budget Committee assailed their Republican colleagues for shedding their deficit hawk feathers and backing a bill that they say is fiscally irresponsible. Many Republican senators left after protesters disrupted the meeting, chanting, “Kill the bill.” Acknowledging that a final vote was most likely days away, Democratic leaders appeared to have few procedural maneuvers left to slow the progress of the tax bill. “Our Republican colleagues, in their rush to get a bill done, are legislating in an irresponsible way, especially when it comes to something as important and complex as the tax code,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader.","WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans took a significant step toward passing a sweeping tax overhaul on Tuesday, with a key panel giving its approval and several wavering senators indicating they would support the tax package, helping clear the way for full Senate consideration later this week.

"PARIS — For Nohemi Gonzalez, a bubbly and determined first-generation Mexican-American from California, studying industrial design in Paris was the culmination of a dream. Ms. Gonzalez, a student at California State University, Long Beach, was spending a semester at the Strate School of Design in Paris. Friends and colleagues said she could barely believe her good fortune to be in the glittering French capital — her first time living in Europe — and had been giddily crisscrossing the city, from the Eiffel Tower to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. But when terrorists armed with assault rifles and explosives attacked restaurants, a stadium and a concert hall in and around Paris on Friday night, Ms. Gonzalez, 23, was one of the 129 people killed. The victims came from 19 countries, including Germany, Chile and Tunisia. Ms. Gonzalez was the only American known to have died in the attacks. But she was emblematic of dozens of the other victims: Young. Ambitious. Chasing dreams. And eager to absorb the sophisticated swagger of a city rich in history and culture where generations of young hopefuls have come in search of excitement, aesthetic nourishment and reinvention. As an American, she was also representative of the packs of cheerful, starry-eyed foreigners studying abroad for a semester. At any given time, more than 17,000 students from the United States are living and studying in France. They fill the Métro, the museums, and the concert halls of the French capital, and are a gregarious, sometimes loud and giggling, presence in the cafes and bistros where Parisians also live out their lives. On Friday, Ms. Gonzalez and a group of friends were out for a night on the town and ended up at La Belle Équipe, a lively bistro on Rue de Charonne. Minutes into the meal, a group of militants sprayed bullets at the restaurant’s terrace, killing 19 people, including Ms. Gonzalez. Her friend Niran Jayasiri ran for cover when the firing began and narrowly escaped, according to California State University, where Mr. Jayasiri is a student. “I lost one of my good friends and I’m still trying to process this all but it’s just too much to take,” he wrote in a post on Facebook the day after the attack. “You were one of the most down to earth, cheerful, bubbly, helpful and honest people I knew. I’m grateful that you were my classmate and a true friend. “Rest in peace Nohemi (little one),” he added. “I hope heaven has unlimited supply of baby pugs for you.” Ms. Gonzalez’s family, friends and faculty at California State have given accounts of her as a spirited, hard-working and disciplined young woman, who walked purposely down the halls of the university, laughed easily and enjoyed mentoring other students. Students in the industrial design program recalled that they would sometimes see Ms. Gonzalez in the same clothes from the previous day because she had spent all night working in the design studio. She could become annoyed if others left the studio untidy, they said. Her mother, Beatriz Gonzalez, a hairdresser, said in a television interview with The Associated Press that her daughter, whom the family called Mimi, had “big dreams.” “She was so happy, every day, because she loved to go to school and she was hoping to have a different life,” she said. “Not only like most of our people — like, go to work and come back home every day. She wanted to have a career and a family.” She said the F.B.I. had said that because of the investigation, it would be weeks before her daughter’s body would be sent back to the United States. In a school assignment that required her to create a brand reflecting who she was, Ms. Gonzalez emphasized her Mexican-American heritage, her drive and her independence. “I am Mexican-American and I also happen to be first generation born in the United States,” she wrote, according to Terri Carbaugh, a spokeswoman for the university. “I grew up in Whittier and had a very hardworking mother that raised me to be extremely independent,” Ms. Gonzalez continued, referring to a city in Los Angeles County. “If I had to describe myself in a few words I would say I am very high-spirited, clean, orderly and self-driven.” Ms. Carbaugh said Ms. Gonzalez had stood out at the university as a promising and innovative designer, and a review of some of her work shows a natural flair for memorable designs that are at once contemporary, playful and functional. On Oct. 7 she posted on Facebook that she and a group of students had won second place in a design contest for a biodegradable cardboard container for snacks that could also double as a plant holder. Her designs included Coppertin the Turtle, with a head that bobbed in and out, which she described as an uplifting “desk buddy.” Ms. Gonzalez had also designed intricate and elegant bathroom hooks and a lighting fixture with undulating geometric shapes that drew inspiration from the “majestic landscapes” of Southern California’s beaches and the Grand Canyon, she wrote. Explaining her approach during a recent university design show, she strode on to the stage in a red dress, apologizing that she was a bit nervous. “We’re really lucky to be here,” she said in a video of the event, posted on YouTube, “There’s a lot of people that go through their life and they don’t find their passion. I feel fortunate because not a lot of people get to have higher education. We do get to follow what we love and do it every day.” She explained her design philosophy as an attempt to be eye-catching as well as simple, but with details that would be memorable. She invited students to come talk to her, directing them to her booth in the corner, “away from everyone,” she said, drawing laughter. Her last post on her Facebook page, on Oct. 20, made it clear that she was in Paris to do more than soak up culture. “Learning a 3D modeling computer program in a language I don’t know is up there in the top 3 hardest things I’ve ever had to do,” she wrote. On Sunday, more than 2,000 students and teachers gathered at the university to remember Ms. Gonzalez. Her boyfriend of nearly four years, Tim Mraz, wore a black armband with the French flag. He said he called her Pocahontas, after a tattoo on her left arm. She would have hated seeing herself in the news because “she didn’t like all the attention,” he said. “She was,” he said, a “firecracker.”","PARIS — For Nohemi Gonzalez, a bubbly and determined first-generation Mexican-American from California, studying industrial design in Paris was the culmination of a dream.

"WASHINGTON — The American military strike against Syria threatened Russian-American relations on Friday as the Kremlin denounced President Trump’s use of force and the Russian military announced that it was suspending an agreement to share information about air operations over the country, devised to avoid accidental conflict. Mr. Trump, who has made repairing strained ties with Moscow a central ambition of his presidency, even amid criticism of Russian meddling in last year’s American election, found that goal at risk as the countries traded harsh words in a diplomatic confrontation reminiscent of past dark moments between the two powers. President Vladimir V. Putin’s office called the Tomahawk cruise missile strike on Syria a violation of international law and a “significant blow” to the Russian-American relationship, while Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev said it had “completely ruined” it. Trump administration officials suggested Russia bore some responsibility for the chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians that precipitated the American response. At home, Mr. Trump found support among a broad cross-section of normally critical establishment Republicans and Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and Senator John McCain, who backed the sort of action that President Barack Obama refused to take under similar circumstances four years ago. Mr. Trump was among those who urged Mr. Obama not to order a strike back then, even though many more civilians had been killed at the time. But in a sign of the complicated nature of domestic politics after nearly 16 years of American wars abroad, an odd-bedfellow mix of ideological enemies joined together to criticize Mr. Trump’s action, including antiwar liberals who said it violated the Constitution and isolationist conservatives who called it a betrayal of the values he expressed as a candidate. Even some who supported his action, like Mrs. Clinton, called Mr. Trump hypocritical for lamenting the deaths of Syrian babies while seeking to bar Syrian refugees from the United States. The strike also roiled world capitals and dominated a session of the United Nations. Led by Russia, Syria and its backers denounced it, while American allies in Europe and in Israel, Turkey and Saudi Arabia cheered Mr. Trump on. The debate raged as the president was in Florida hosting a high-stakes summit meeting with President Xi Jinping of China to discuss, among other things, how to contain another international pariah state, North Korea. Mr. Trump left it to others to address the issue on Friday, but his team signaled that no further military strikes were imminent unless the government of President Bashar al-Assad again used chemical weapons against Syria’s people. “The United States took a very measured step last night,” Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said Friday during a special meeting of the Security Council focused on Syria. “We are prepared to do more, but we hope that will not be necessary.” Even as Mr. Trump ordered the first direct American attack on Syria’s government in six years of grinding civil war, the White House indicated no further move to unseat Mr. Assad, leaving the strike to speak for itself. “This action was very decisive, justified and proportional,” said Sean Spicer, the president’s press secretary. “It sent a very strong signal not just to Syria, but throughout the world.” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson characterized the strike as an “overwhelming success” and said Americans should be proud of the “overpowering” force of the American military. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that the United States would impose additional sanctions on Syria, but he did not discuss the timing or targets. But the strike inserted the United States, for a moment at least, into one of the world’s most intractable conflicts and demonstrated the potential dangers of Russian and American forces’ operating in proximity. As many as 100 Russian troops were believed to be stationed at the Syrian air base targeted on Thursday. An American official said the Russians on the ground had been given 60 to 90 minutes’ notice that the missiles were coming and had not been advised whether to take shelter or flee. Although Russia did not deploy its air defense system in Syria against the American missiles, it flexed its military muscles after the attack. Moscow said it would bolster Syria’s air defenses, and the Russian news agency Tass reported that a frigate would enter the Mediterranean Sea on Friday and visit the logistics base at Tartus, a Syrian port. The Russian military said it would shut down a hotline established to prevent accidental clashes in the skies over Syria. While the two sides used the channel earlier on Friday, Russian officials said it would be cut off at the end of the day. The United States and Russia have other ways to track each other’s aircraft and avoid collisions, but American officials considered the hotline an important vehicle to ensure safety, as well as a valuable political connection. Even as Moscow protested, American officials pointed fingers back, faulting the Kremlin for not enforcing a 2013 agreement it brokered with Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons. “Clearly, Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013,” Mr. Tillerson said late Thursday night. “So either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement.” Russia, which sent armed forces to Syria in 2015 to bolster Mr. Assad against insurgents, denied that his government was behind the chemical attack on Tuesday in Idlib Province that left more than 80 people dead, calling that a pretext. Instead, Moscow said a conventional strike had hit a chemical weapons warehouse controlled by insurgents, an explanation dismissed in the West. “The Syrian Army has no chemical weapons at its disposal,” said Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, blaming “terrorists” for the attack. Syria condemned the American strike as “a disgraceful act,” news agencies reported. A statement from Mr. Assad’s office said the cruise missile strike was a result of “a false propaganda campaign.” Syria has denied that it has chemical weapons. The cruise missiles struck Al Shayrat airfield at 3:40 a.m. Friday local time (8:40 p.m. Thursday in Washington), targeting the base that American officials said had conducted the chemical weapons attack. The missiles were aimed at Syrian aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, radars, air defense systems, ammunition bunkers and fuel storage sites. American military planners avoided sites that they suspected held chemical agents, officials said. Syrian officials and news outlets reported that six soldiers and nine civilians had been killed. Talal Barazi, the governor of Homs Province, said the civilians had died from shrapnel wounds. American military officials said 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles had struck their targets at the airfield, destroying 20 to 25 aircraft: roughly 20 percent of the Seventh Wing of the Syrian Air Force. One missile aborted after launch and fell into the Mediterranean. But a spokesman for the Russian military, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, called the effectiveness of the American airstrikes “extremely low,” asserting that just 23 had hit their targets. The American missiles, according to the Russian military, destroyed a warehouse of matériel and technical property, a training building, a canteen, six MIG-23 aircraft in repair hangars, and a radar station. Evgeny Poddubny, a Russian television reporter who was at the air base, said nine planes had been destroyed. The strike plan was put together at the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla., and alternatives were developed within hours of the chemical attack. When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis briefed Mr. Trump on Thursday, the options had already been winnowed to a Tomahawk cruise missile strike at Al Shayrat. Two American destroyers, the Porter and the Ross, were already in position in the eastern Mediterranean. Mr. Trump gave the order on Thursday afternoon, shortly before hosting Mr. Xi for dinner, and confided in the Chinese leader only as the meal was breaking up, aides said. The presence of Russian military personnel at the airfield complicated the decision. Given the Russians’ presence, American officials said they must have known about or turned a blind eye to the Syrian chemical weapons. The United States notified the Russian forces on the ground in a conversation described as lengthy, with the Russians doing much of the talking. The Russians were at a part of the base that was not struck, Pentagon officials said. The chemical assault on Tuesday struck the town of Khan Sheikhoun with what Turkey has identified as sarin, a banned nerve agent. American officials said intelligence agencies had monitored the attack, mapping the radar tracks showing Syrian warplanes leaving and returning to the base. The attack killed 84 people, and 546 others were injured, Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, told reporters in Geneva, citing health officials in Idlib Province. United Nations officials said heavy fighting in other parts of Syria had killed hundreds more civilians. Bombings in Idlib and Raqqa Provinces in recent weeks, including by a United States-led coalition, were the most intensive recorded in the Syrian conflict, said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the United Nations’ human rights office. More than 130 civilians were killed and 170 injured in the same month in Raqqa, the center of the Islamic State — the vast majority in coalition airstrikes, Ms. Shamdasani said. Syrian government airstrikes conducted over two days in early April on Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital, Damascus, killed at least 42 civilians, she added. In the hours after the American missile strike, Iran — Russia’s main ally in the region in helping Mr. Assad — condemned it as “dangerous, destructive and a violation of international law.” But Britain expressed support, as did Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France, who issued a joint statement saying that Mr. Assad “bears sole responsibility.” A spokesman for Turkey’s government said the American strike had been a positive response to “war crimes” in Syria, while a Saudi official praised the “courageous decision” by Mr. Trump. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he hoped it would “resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere.” Clues to how Moscow will respond might not come until Tuesday, when Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil and an old friend of the Kremlin, is set to make his first visit to Russia as secretary of state. “There will be many screams on the Russian television with people condemning the strikes, but everybody understands that this is just a symbolic act meant for Trump to look different from Obama,” said Vladimir Frolov, a foreign affairs analyst. “There won’t be any tangible reaction; this was a one-off strike.” Others suggested that the lack of an initial Russian military reaction in Syria pointed to a realistic approach. “Moscow might not like Washington’s response,” Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian military, wrote in an online commentary, “but nor was it willing to stand in the way of it.”","WASHINGTON — The American military strike against Syria threatened Russian-American relations on Friday as the Kremlin denounced President Trump’s use of force and the Russian military announced that it was suspending an agreement to share information about air operations over the country, devised to avoid accidental conflict.

"WASHINGTON — The release of three American prisoners cleared away a last obstacle on Wednesday to a landmark nuclear summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. North Korea freed the prisoners, all Americans of Korean descent, even as the two countries finalized details for a meeting between their leaders. The move was North Korea’s most tangible gesture aimed at improving relations with the United States since Mr. Trump took office. The resolution of the prisoner standoff hardly guaranteed success at the meeting, which will grapple with the far more complicated issues of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, divisions on the peninsula and security in Asia. But American officials said it sent another signal that North Korea may be serious about ending its long confrontation with the United States and its allies after nearly seven decades of mutual antagonism. Mr. Trump exulted over the release and publicly entertained talk that he could even win a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomacy. He was so eager to associate himself with the freed prisoners that he decided to personally travel to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington in the middle of the night to welcome them back to the United States, something other presidents have not typically done in similar circumstances. “Nobody thought this was going to happen, and if it did, it would be years or decades, frankly,” Mr. Trump said at the White House shortly after they were released. “Nobody thought this was going to happen. And I appreciate Kim Jong-un for doing this and allowing them to go.” The three were handed over to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who made a second visit to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to lock down details of the upcoming meeting between the president and Mr. Kim. Mr. Trump said it would not be held in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, as he had earlier suggested, and speculation centered on Singapore, a neutral site that has better facilities and is close to North Korea. The United States has persistently demanded the release of its three citizens — Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song — who have all been held on charges of committing espionage or unidentified “hostile acts” against North Korea. Two of them were arrested after Mr. Trump took office last year. “For Trump, the release validates his view that only he can effectively negotiate with North Korea,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama. “For Kim, it helps him undermine the maximum pressure campaign, which has probably peaked, and drives up the price and lengthens the timeline for denuclearization.” The three freed prisoners issued a statement as they made their way to Washington. “We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo and the people of the United States for bringing us home,” they said. “We thank God, and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return. God bless America, the greatest nation in the world.” In the first comments attributed to Kim Jong-un confirming the planned meeting, the North Korean news agency said he expressed thanks to Mr. Trump for showing “deep interest in settling the issue through dialogue” and said the session would be an “excellent first step toward promotion of the positive situation development in the Korean Peninsula.” During his one-day trip to Pyongyang, Mr. Pompeo and senior North Korean officials exchanged optimistic words about the future of the relationship. At a lunch of poached fish and duck and red wine, on the 39th floor of the Koryo Hotel, Kim Yong-chol, a vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party and Mr. Pompeo’s main interlocutor, said that after years of expending treasure on developing nuclear weapons, North Korea had decided to pivot to focus on improving the lives of its people. “It is our policy to concentrate all efforts into economic progress in our country,” Kim Yong-chol said, echoing a policy shift that Kim Jong-un adopted at a party meeting last month. “I hope the United States also will be happy with our success,” he added. “I have high expectations the U.S. will play a very big role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.” But Kim Yong-chol also said the decision to talk with the United States was “not a result of sanctions that have been imposed from outside,” despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to take credit. Mr. Pompeo returned the friendly tone in his own toast. “For decades, we have been adversaries,” he said. “Now we are hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve.” American detainees in North Korea have been an especially delicate issue. Otto F. Warmbier, an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, died last June shortly after being released in a coma after spending 17 months in captivity in North Korea for trying to take a propaganda poster while on a trip there. His parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, recently filed a lawsuit accusing North Korea of kidnapping and fatally torturing their son. His death hung over the case of the three other prisoners. Mr. Trump called Mr. Warmbier’s parents last Friday, knowing it would be difficult for them to watch the safe return of other Americans from Pyongyang, White House officials said. On Wednesday, after the release, Vice President Mike Pence called the parents, and Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, opened a cabinet meeting with a prayer for Mr. Warmbier. The first indication that North Korea was willing to talk about releasing the three prisoners came in March when it raised the possibility of meeting with Mr. Pompeo about the presidential meeting and indicated that the detainees could be a point of discussion during his visit, according to White House officials, who insisted on anonymity to provide an account of internal discussions. Mr. Trump cautioned against offering concessions in exchange for the prisoners, insisting that if Mr. Kim was sincere about meeting with him, he would recognize that he needed to take the initiative and free them. Mr. Pompeo returned from that initial trip over Easter weekend optimistic, the officials said, telling Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence that he was encouraged by preparations for the meeting and the prospects for getting the prisoners back. On May 2, according to the officials, Mr. Pence met in the White House Situation Room with Mr. Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, to discuss plans for the summit meeting after the North Koreans had requested a second visit by Mr. Pompeo. The invitation signaled progress, but Mr. Trump’s advisers decided to recommend that Mr. Trump condition a second visit by Mr. Pompeo on firm commitments from Pyongyang on the location and date for the summit meeting plus the release of the three Americans. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, joined them in bringing the idea to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump agreed. “We’re going to get the problem solved,” he said, according to the White House officials. “Bring our boys home,” Mr. Pence told Mr. Pompeo. White House officials knew that once Mr. Pompeo left his plane in Pyongyang, he would lose the ability to communicate securely during the 13 hours he would spend on the ground. They were cautious about saying anything about the clandestine mission until the detainees were on an American government plane. Mr. Pence kept the secret on Tuesday when he briefed senators on Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal. Asked about the prisoners, the vice president said only that the administration was working diligently to free them. Mr. Trump was less discreet, telling reporters that “we’ll all soon be finding out” whether the detainees would come home. Mr. Pence spoke with Mr. Pompeo when his plane landed Wednesday in Japan and received an update on the condition of the freed prisoners, who were described as healthy and able to walk on their own. All three ran afoul of a government deeply suspicious of foreigners. Kim Dong-chul, a businessman and naturalized American citizen from the Virginia suburbs of Washington, was arrested in October 2015, convicted of spying and sentenced to 10 years’ hard labor. Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk, was arrested in April 2017 while trying to board a plane to leave the country. He had spent a month teaching accounting at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, a Christian-funded college. Kim Hak-song, who volunteered at the college’s agricultural research farm, was arrested in May 2017. According to CNN, he was born in China near the North Korean border and emigrated to the United States in the 1990s, later returning to China and eventually moving to Pyongyang. “This show of good will is a positive signal for the U.S.-North Korean summit because it reflects a willingness to negotiate and compromise,” said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, South Korea. “It also delivers a political score for the scandal-ridden President Trump at home, giving him something to brag about.” But Evans J. R. Revere, a former State Department diplomat who specializes in East Asia, pointed out that North Korea has a long history of seizing and imprisoning Americans, then using them as bargaining chips. “I would not give Pyongyang too much credit for undoing something it shouldn’t have been doing in the first place,” he said.","WASHINGTON — The release of three American prisoners cleared away a last obstacle on Wednesday to a landmark nuclear summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

"WASHINGTON — Nearly three weeks after Election Day, Hillary Clinton’s campaign said on Saturday that it would participate in a recount process in Wisconsin incited by a third-party candidate and would join any potential recounts in two other closely contested states, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The Clinton campaign held out little hope of success in any of the three states, and said it had seen no “actionable evidence” of vote hacking that might taint the results or otherwise provide new grounds for challenging Donald J. Trump’s victory. But it suggested it was going along with the recount effort to assure supporters that it was doing everything possible to verify that hacking by Russia or other irregularities had not affected the results. In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team’s general counsel, said the campaign would take part in the Wisconsin recount being set off by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, and would also participate if Ms. Stein made good on her plans to seek recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Mrs. Clinton lost those three states by a total of little more than 100,000 votes, sealing her Electoral College defeat  by Mr. Trump. The Clinton campaign had assailed Mr. Trump during the election for refusing to say he would abide by the results if he lost. On Saturday, Mr. Trump responded to the campaign’s decision to join the recount with a statement calling the effort “ridiculous” and “a scam by the Green Party.” He suggested that most of the money raised would not be spent on the recount. “The results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,” Mr. Trump said. In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22,177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10,704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70,638 votes. Mr. Elias suggested in his essay that the Clinton campaign was joining the recount effort with little expectation that it would change the result. But many of the campaign’s supporters, picking up on its frequent complaints of Russian interference in the election, have enthusiastically backed Ms. Stein’s efforts, putting pressure on the Clinton team to show that it is exploring all options. Mr. Elias used his essay to describe an intensive behind-the-scenes effort by the campaign to look for signs of Russian hacking activity or other irregularities in the vote count. Ms. Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday afternoon, about an hour before the deadline. She has raised more than $5 million for the effort, which will now turn to Michigan and Pennsylvania, where there are deadlines in the coming week. In his post, Mr. Elias sounded less enthusiastic than the recount’s many supporters. “Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology,” he wrote, “we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves.” He added, “Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.” If Ms. Stein pursues additional recounts, “we will take the same approach in those states as well,” he wrote. But he noted that the “number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states — Michigan — well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount.” The Clinton campaign will not contribute financially to the effort, which has been funded by small contributions. But it will pay to have its own lawyers present at the recount, campaign officials said. The Obama administration issued a statement to The New York Times on Friday in response to questions about intelligence findings related to Russian interference in the election. In the statement, it said it had concluded that the election was free of interference. The administration issued a second statement on Saturday saying that “the federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day.” Mrs. Clinton conceded the race to Mr. Trump early on Nov. 9, when it became clear that he would have a large margin of victory in the Electoral College. But as her lead in the popular vote has grown — it now exceeds two million votes — her base has increasingly pressured her to challenge the results. That has been fueled in part by how aggressively the Clinton campaign spread the word of Russian involvement in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and from the personal account of John D. Podesta, the campaign’s chairman. The campaign also charged that the Russians were behind fake news about Mrs. Clinton’s health, among other stories — a claim supported to some extent by recent studies. Some critics saw those accusations as an effort to shift the discussion from mistakes the Clinton campaign had made in taking on Mr. Trump. Mr. Elias’s post offered a revealing look at how much time and energy the campaign had spent in the past two weeks looking for evidence of Russian hacking or other irregularities, and how it had tried to keep those efforts secret.  “Since the day after the election, we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result,” Mr. Elias wrote. “Most of those discussions have remained private, while at least one has unfortunately been the subject of leaks,” he wrote, a reference to conversations between Mr. Podesta and a group of experts that included J. Alex Halderman, a computer scientist with deep experience in the vulnerabilities of voting systems. Mr. Halderman recently put his own post on Medium, describing his suspicions and the case for recounts. But even he doubted that the election result would change.","WASHINGTON — Nearly three weeks after Election Day, Hillary Clinton’s campaign said on Saturday that it would participate in a recount process in Wisconsin incited by a third-party candidate and would join any potential recounts in two other closely contested states, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
